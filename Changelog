JG-2001-12-06-0: Bugfix:    Cull hash implementation: When cull objects were 
                            received and unpacked, all fields that did not 
                            have a hash table in the original had a unique
                            hash table created.

                            jobs algorithm to correct problem where certain
                            pending jobs were not considered for scheduling.

JG-2001-11-07-1: Bugfix: Retrieving a string value from a cull object field 
                 and setting this value again for the same field produced a 
                 memory access error.

                 qmaster and scheduler - they are no longer needed, 
                 as cull hashing functionality was enabled for job
                 lists.

AH-2001-10-29-0: Qmaster:

CR-2001-10-26-1: Testsuite:
                  - bugfix for path_alias check: problems with file
                    creating on NFS directory. The check will now make
                    sure that the correct/updated path_alias files are 
                    used (diffing file output on each execution host in
                    setup procedure). 

CR-2001-10-26-0: Source: 
                  - Added variable initialization
                  - Removed double defined message

JG-2001-10-25-0: Fixed some memory leaks

JG-2001-10-23-0: Fixed a bug in the implementation of non unique hash tables:
                 The key data has to be duplicated in the hash table.
                 Therefore a duplication function has to be passed when
                 creating a new hash table.

JG-2001-10-22-0: Fixed a memory access error in the cull hash implementation

EB-2001-10-20-0: Added 'const' in libraries

JG-2001-10-18-0: Execd:
                  - bugfix: reporting of a parallel array jobs pe task in
                            tight integration could fail.
                  - use cull hashing iterators for searches in job list          

JG-2001-10-17-0: (Issue #57)
                 Sparc Linux port (32 bit). Grid Engine platform slinux.
                 The port is restricted to SGE as the pdc module had to be 
                 disabled for slinux (aimk variable COMPILE_DC).

JG-2001-10-16-0: Implemented the use of hash tables for cull lists.
                 The list definition (libs/gdi/sge_*L.h) contains information, 
                 for which data fields hash tables shall be generated.
                 Hash tables are created and maintained by the cull list 
                 access functions (lCreateList, lAppendElem etc.) and are used
                 by the cull search functions (lGetElem*).
                 Defined default hash tables for the most used cull lists.
                 Increased the GDI version - the spooling file format and
                 the message format changed.

EB-2001-10-11-1: Changed MAX_SEQNUM from 999,999 to 9,999,999.
                 - changed qstat output format

EB-2001-10-11-0: Changed spool behaviour for (array) jobs
                 - beared down the 32765 subdirectory limit
                 - added some tuning parameters for job spooling
                 - collected duplicated code used in master and execd 

CR-2001-10-10-1: Testsuite:
                 - closed issue # 9 (Create a new test for file parsing)

CR-2001-10-10-0: Testsuite:
                 - new command line option: mfile FILE
                   (don't mail messages, write it to file)
                 - new optional parameter for procedure "wait_for_jobstart"
                   (do a qconf -tsm before waiting for jobstart) 

CR-2001-10-09-2: (sge_rusage.c)
                 - Issue #68 (The accounting file handles only entries < 2048 
                              chars/line)

CR-2001-10-09-1: (rmon_macros.c)
                 - don't use vnsprintf() for ALPHA4 and IRIX6

CR-2001-10-09-0: (parse_job_cull.c)
                 - Issue #67 (long lines in sge_request files causes bus error
                             in qsub)
                 - removed some local char str[1024] definitions and replaced
                   it with error_string buffer one function level above
                 (rmon_macros.c) 
                 - using vnsprintf() system call as default (instead of vsprintf)
                   This should prevent a buffer overflow error
                     
                 

JG-2001-10-09-0: Added statistics for our hashtable implementation that gives
                 following info:
                  - size of hashtable and number of elements stored
                  - number of empty hash chains
                  - maximum and average chain length
                 When a hashtable is resized and log_level is set to log_debug,
                 statistics and profiling information is output to messages 
                 files.

JG-2001-10-08-0: Enabled options -h and -hold_jid for qrsh

AH-2001-10-05-0: Removed warning message in execd

                 - remove/displace code
                 - comments/formatting

JG-2001-10-04-0: Generalized our hash table implementation to support any
                 data type for keys.
                 Hash table uses hash and compare functions to be specified
                 when a table is created.
                 Hash and compare functions for strings and u_long32 are
                 provided.

EB-2001-10-04-0: (Issue #7)
                 - changed spool behaviour for (array) jobs

AH-2001-10-02-0: Schedd: Moved code handling 'forced' attributes to a section 
                 handling other static matchings. Static matchings can be done
                 independently of consumables/load values and thus needs be done
                 less frequent

CR-2001-09-26-0: Testsuite:
                 - new setup file version

                 - Issue #54 : New test: sge_aliases file  

CR-2001-09-18-0: Testsuite:
                 - sending CR (carriage return) before starting remote command
                   (to stop eventually switched on correct questions) on rlogin
                   call
                 - wait longer before sending password (some login daemons
                   don't accept fast password typing)

CR-2001-09-17-0: Fixed issue #60 "COMMPROC ALLREADY REGISTERED" error

AH-2001-09-14-2: Fixed error with job array causing dispatch of the last
                 array-job being postponed to the follow-up scheduling interval

JG-2001-09-12-0: (Issue #58)
                 - scheduler optimization: sorting of hosts is only done
                   when really necessary.
                 - schedd can output profiling information - set schedd_params
                   to profile
                 - some smaller bugfixes  

AA-2001-09-06-0: Fixed y out of range of allowed Xserver values in QControl
                 This limits the number of displayable qs to 2758

JG-2001-09-03-0: (Issue #51)
                 - PWD was set incorrectly for jobs submitted with qsub -cwd
                   if a path mapping was active (sge_aliases file)
                 - qrsh does no longer use the PWD variable to determine 
                   target job working directory but jobs configuration

CR-2001-08-31-0: Testsuite:
                 - issue #10 shutdown_system_daemon does not work for some platforms

                 and 'Meattr' (Issue# 50)

AA-2001-08-28-0: Fixed task array job handling in qmon submit dialogue (Issue# 48)

EB-2001-08-27-0: Fixed segmentation fault in qstat, qhost, qmon (Issue# 48)
                 - large, fragmented job arrays caused segmentation
                   fault in qstat when the task id range list should be
                   printed                                                                       
                 - hold of a list of array tasks in the job control dialog
                   caused only the last one to be set into the hold-state 

CR-2001-08-23-2: Testsuite:
                 - using full path name for files to check in procedure
                   check_executable_files

                 - removed add_proc_error call in compile_source procedure
                   (output buffer overflow error). Now the error is only
                   reported in the normal testsuite output. In case of
                   parallel compiling more architectures this error message
                   sometimes appears.
