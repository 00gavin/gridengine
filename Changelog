JG-2001-11-26-1: Fixed a (non critical) read to uninitialized memory in 
                 the code retrieving memory load values on solaris.

JG-2001-11-26-0: Added qconf options -secl (show event client list) and
                 -kec (kill event client).

AH-2001-11-23-1: Removed unused configuration parameters in queue 
                 configuration (IssueZilla #71) and scheduler configuration 
                 (Bugtraq #4431000). 
                 
                 This requires manual removal of certain parameters before 
                 restarting daemons
                     - max_migr_time
                     - migr_load_thresholds
                     - max_no_migr
                     - klog
                     - reauth_time
                 from all queue configurations stored in 
                     $SGE_ROOT/default/spool/qmaster/queues/*
                 and 
                     - maxgjobs
                 from the scheduler configuration in
                     $SGE_ROOT/default/common/sched_configuration

                 This change is not yet done in qmon but only in the core 
                 system. Please don't try to compile qmon until qmon has been 
                 updated accordingly (aimk -no-qmon).

AH-2001-11-23-0: Enhanced queue priority range to -20 to +20
                 changed data type of queue priority from ulong to string
                 removed priority attribute from queue complex

CR-2001-11-23-1: Implementation of the lHostT cull data type. Modified
                 each cull list where a hostname is stored. The lHostT
                 data type is implemented like the lStringT type, but
                 only used for hostnames.

                 Bugfix of issuzilla bug id 63


CR-2001-11-23-0: Testsuite:

AH-2001-11-21-1: Added NO_REPRIORIZATION setting in qmaster_params to allow 
                 for diabling the PTF module. Without this setting the 
                 'priority' parameter in queue_conf(5) has no effect in a 
                 SGEEE system.

JG-2001-11-20-0: Generalized event client interface.
                 The former event client interface was very scheduler specific.
                 Only one event client - the scheduler - could register.
                 Now any number of event client can register at qmaster and
                 receive events.
                 A sample event client can be found in clients/qevent.
                 Further cleanup steps and documentation still has to be done.
                 A subscribe/unsubscribe mechanism does not yet exist.

AH-2001-11-20-0: Bugfix: Bugtraq #4528905, IssueZilla #78
                 Use kstat interface instead of kvm interface for retrieval
                 of cpu percentage load value to fix problems with
                 Solaris 7,8 running 32-bit kernels

JG-2001-11-15-0: Performance/Scalability optimization: 
                 Defined hash tables on a number of objects to speed up 
                 search operations.
                 Changed the order in which non unique hashed objects
                 are stored - some code relies on getting them in the
                 same order they were stored.

EB-2001-11-13-0: Bugfix (Issue #92; Bugtraq #4525963):
                  - Qmaster did not change the reschedule unknown
                    value immediately after using the qconf command.

                      command line -> master_debug, schedd_debug and display 
                                      master and scheduler can now be
                                      started in debug mode

CR-2001-10-26-1: Testsuite:
                  - bugfix for path_alias check: problems with file
                    creating on NFS directory. The check will now make
                    sure that the correct/updated path_alias files are 
                    used (diffing file output on each execution host in

JG-2001-10-25-0: Fixed some memory leaks

JG-2001-10-23-0: Fixed a bug in the implementation of non unique hash tables:
                 The key data has to be duplicated in the hash table.
                 Therefore a duplication function has to be passed when
                 creating a new hash table.

JG-2001-10-22-0: Fixed a memory access error in the cull hash implementation

EB-2001-10-20-0: Added 'const' in libraries

JG-2001-10-18-0: Execd:
                  - bugfix: reporting of a parallel array jobs pe task in
                            tight integration could fail.
                  - use cull hashing iterators for searches in job list          

JG-2001-10-17-0: (Issue #57)
                 Sparc Linux port (32 bit). Grid Engine platform slinux.
                 The port is restricted to SGE as the pdc module had to be 
                 disabled for slinux (aimk variable COMPILE_DC).

JG-2001-10-16-0: Implemented the use of hash tables for cull lists.
                 The list definition (libs/gdi/sge_*L.h) contains information, 
                 for which data fields hash tables shall be generated.
                 Hash tables are created and maintained by the cull list 
                 access functions (lCreateList, lAppendElem etc.) and are used
                 by the cull search functions (lGetElem*).
                 Defined default hash tables for the most used cull lists.
                 Increased the GDI version - the spooling file format and
                 the message format changed.

EB-2001-10-11-1: Changed MAX_SEQNUM from 999,999 to 9,999,999.
                 - changed qstat output format

EB-2001-10-11-0: Changed spool behaviour for (array) jobs
                 - beared down the 32765 subdirectory limit
                 - added some tuning parameters for job spooling
                 - collected duplicated code used in master and execd 

CR-2001-10-10-1: Testsuite:
                 - closed issue # 9 (Create a new test for file parsing)

CR-2001-10-10-0: Testsuite:
                 - new command line option: mfile FILE
                   (don't mail messages, write it to file)
                 - new optional parameter for procedure "wait_for_jobstart"
                   (do a qconf -tsm before waiting for jobstart) 

CR-2001-10-09-2: (sge_rusage.c)
                 - Issue #68 (The accounting file handles only entries < 2048 
                              chars/line)

CR-2001-10-09-1: (rmon_macros.c)
                 - don't use vnsprintf() for ALPHA4 and IRIX6

CR-2001-10-09-0: (parse_job_cull.c)
                 - Issue #67 (long lines in sge_request files causes bus error
                             in qsub)
                 - removed some local char str[1024] definitions and replaced
                   it with error_string buffer one function level above
                 (rmon_macros.c) 
                 - using vnsprintf() system call as default (instead of vsprintf)
                   This should prevent a buffer overflow error
                     
                 

JG-2001-10-09-0: Added statistics for our hashtable implementation that gives
                 following info:
                  - size of hashtable and number of elements stored
                  - number of empty hash chains
                  - maximum and average chain length
                 When a hashtable is resized and log_level is set to log_debug,
                 statistics and profiling information is output to messages 
                 files.

JG-2001-10-08-0: Enabled options -h and -hold_jid for qrsh

JG-2001-10-04-0: Generalized our hash table implementation to support any
                 data type for keys.
                 Hash table uses hash and compare functions to be specified
                 when a table is created.
                 Hash and compare functions for strings and u_long32 are
                 provided.

EB-2001-10-04-0: (Issue #7)
                 - changed spool behaviour for (array) jobs

AH-2001-10-02-0: Schedd: Moved code handling 'forced' attributes to a section 
                 handling other static matchings. Static matchings can be done
                 independently of consumables/load values and thus needs be done
                 less frequent

SD-2001-10-01-0: Updated the SGEEE pending job algorithm.

                 WARNING - WARNING - WARNING - WARNING - WARNING - WARNING

                 This update changes the binary job structure spooled to disk.  
                 This means that if you are already running with the open source 
                 code, you will need to delete all pending and active jobs before 
                 running with the new SGE binaries. This is true if you are running 
                 either SGE or SGEEE.

                 array-job being postponed to the follow-up scheduling interval

JG-2001-09-12-0: (Issue #58)
                 - scheduler optimization: sorting of hosts is only done
                   when really necessary.
                 - schedd can output profiling information - set schedd_params
                   to profile
                 - some smaller bugfixes  

AA-2001-09-06-0: Fixed y out of range of allowed Xserver values in QControl

JG-2001-09-03-0: (Issue #51)
                 - PWD was set incorrectly for jobs submitted with qsub -cwd
                   if a path mapping was active (sge_aliases file)
                 - qrsh does no longer use the PWD variable to determine 
                   target job working directory but jobs configuration

CR-2001-08-31-0: Testsuite:
                 - issue #10 shutdown_system_daemon does not work for some platforms

EB-2001-08-27-0: Fixed segmentation fault in qstat, qhost, qmon (Issue# 48)
                 - large, fragmented job arrays caused segmentation
                   fault in qstat when the task id range list should be
                   printed                                                                       
                 - hold of a list of array tasks in the job control dialog
                   caused only the last one to be set into the hold-state 

CR-2001-08-23-2: Testsuite:

                 - removed add_proc_error call in compile_source procedure
                   (output buffer overflow error). Now the error is only
                   reported in the normal testsuite output. In case of
                   parallel compiling more architectures this error message
                   sometimes appears.

                 - cleaned up on job logging code
                 - added job logging also to Schedd

                      (removed add_proc_error call in compile_source on full_buffer)
                      (full_buffer themes not to work correctly for multiple spawn/
                       expect calls)

                 - improved error output concerning tasks to be deleted 
                   (former output contained only job id), additional messages:
                   job "1595" task "4" does not exist
