                            The consequence is that the old certificates are
                            no longer usable and must be regenerated with 
                            the new sge_ca script. This affects also the daemon

                            during installation. So the best solution is to 
                            rebuild the whole certificate infrastructure from
                            scratch.

JG-2001-11-20-0: Feature:   Generalized event client interface.
                            The former event client interface was very
                            scheduler specific.  Only one event client - the
                            scheduler - could register.  Now any number of
                            event client can register at qmaster and receive
                            events.
                            A sample event client can be found in
                            clients/qevent.  Further cleanup steps and
                            documentation still has to be done.  A
                            subscribe/unsubscribe mechanism does not yet
                            exist.

JG-2001-11-15-0: Feature:   Performance/Scalability optimization: 
                            Defined hash tables on a number of objects to
                            speed up search operations.
                            Changed the order in which non unique hashed
                            objects are stored - some code relies on getting
                            them in the same order they were stored.

                 qmaster and scheduler - they are no longer needed, 
                 as cull hashing functionality was enabled for job

CR-2001-10-26-1: Testsuite:
                  - bugfix for path_alias check: problems with file
                    creating on NFS directory. The check will now make
                    sure that the correct/updated path_alias files are 
                    used (diffing file output on each execution host in

CR-2001-10-26-0: Source:

JG-2001-10-25-0: Fixed some memory leaks

JG-2001-10-23-0: Fixed a bug in the implementation of non unique hash tables:
                 The key data has to be duplicated in the hash table.
                 Therefore a duplication function has to be passed when
                 creating a new hash table.

JG-2001-10-22-0: Fixed a memory access error in the cull hash implementation

EB-2001-10-20-0: Added 'const' in libraries

JG-2001-10-18-0: Execd:
                  - bugfix: reporting of a parallel array jobs pe task in
                            tight integration could fail.
                  - use cull hashing iterators for searches in job list          

JG-2001-10-17-0: (Issue #57)
                 Sparc Linux port (32 bit). Grid Engine platform slinux.
                 The port is restricted to SGE as the pdc module had to be 
                 disabled for slinux (aimk variable COMPILE_DC).

JG-2001-10-16-0: Implemented the use of hash tables for cull lists.
                 The list definition (libs/gdi/sge_*L.h) contains information, 
                 for which data fields hash tables shall be generated.
                 Hash tables are created and maintained by the cull list 
                 access functions (lCreateList, lAppendElem etc.) and are used
                 by the cull search functions (lGetElem*).
                 Defined default hash tables for the most used cull lists.
                 Increased the GDI version - the spooling file format and
                 the message format changed.

EB-2001-10-11-1: Changed MAX_SEQNUM from 999,999 to 9,999,999.
                 - changed qstat output format

EB-2001-10-11-0: Changed spool behaviour for (array) jobs
                 - beared down the 32765 subdirectory limit
                 - added some tuning parameters for job spooling
                 - collected duplicated code used in master and execd 

CR-2001-10-10-1: Testsuite:
                 - closed issue #9 (Create a new test for file parsing)

CR-2001-10-10-0: Testsuite:
                 - new command line option: mfile FILE
                   (don't mail messages, write it to file)
                 - new optional parameter for procedure "wait_for_jobstart"
                   (do a qconf -tsm before waiting for jobstart) 

CR-2001-10-09-2: (sge_rusage.c)
                 - Issue #68 (The accounting file handles only entries < 2048 
                              chars/line)

CR-2001-10-09-1: (rmon_macros.c)
                 - don't use vnsprintf() for ALPHA4 and IRIX6

CR-2001-10-09-0: (parse_job_cull.c)
                 - Issue #67 (long lines in sge_request files causes bus error
                             in qsub)
                 - removed some local char str[1024] definitions and replaced
                   it with error_string buffer one function level above
                 (rmon_macros.c) 
                 - using vnsprintf() system call as default (instead of vsprintf)
                   This should prevent a buffer overflow error
                     
JG-2001-10-09-0: Added statistics for our hashtable implementation that gives
                 following info:
                  - size of hashtable and number of elements stored
                  - number of empty hash chains
                  - maximum and average chain length
                 When a hashtable is resized and log_level is set to log_debug,
                 statistics and profiling information is output to messages 
                 files.

JG-2001-10-04-0: Generalized our hash table implementation to support any
                 data type for keys.
                 Hash table uses hash and compare functions to be specified
                 when a table is created.
                 Hash and compare functions for strings and u_long32 are
                 provided.

EB-2001-10-04-0: (Issue #7)
                 - changed spool behaviour for (array) jobs

AH-2001-10-02-0: Schedd: Moved code handling 'forced' attributes to a section 
                 handling other static matchings. Static matchings can be done
                 independently of consumables/load values and thus needs be done
                 less frequent

SD-2001-10-01-0: Updated the SGEEE pending job algorithm.

                 WARNING - WARNING - WARNING - WARNING - WARNING - WARNING

                 This update changes the binary job structure spooled to disk.  
                 This means that if you are already running with the open source 
                 code, you will need to delete all pending and active jobs before 
                 running with the new SGE binaries. This is true if you are running 
                 either SGE or SGEEE.

CR-2001-09-26-0: Testsuite:

CR-2001-09-18-0: Testsuite:
                 - sending CR (carriage return) before starting remote command

                   call
                 - wait longer before sending password (some login daemons
                   don't accept fast password typing)

CR-2001-09-17-0: Fixed issue #60 "COMMPROC ALLREADY REGISTERED" error

AH-2001-09-14-2: Fixed error with job array causing dispatch of the last
                 array-job being postponed to the follow-up scheduling interval

JG-2001-09-12-0: (Issue #58)
                 - scheduler optimization: sorting of hosts is only done
                   when really necessary.
                 - schedd can output profiling information - set schedd_params
                   to profile
                 - some smaller bugfixes  

AA-2001-09-06-0: Fixed y out of range of allowed Xserver values in QControl
                 This limits the number of displayable qs to 2758

JG-2001-09-03-0: (Issue #51)
                 - PWD was set incorrectly for jobs submitted with qsub -cwd
                   if a path mapping was active (sge_aliases file)
                 - qrsh does no longer use the PWD variable to determine 
                   target job working directory but jobs configuration

CR-2001-08-31-0: Testsuite:

                   parallel compiling more architectures this error message
                   sometimes appears.
