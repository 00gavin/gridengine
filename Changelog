AH-2002-04-29-1: Change:    In the sched_conf(5) man page it was wrongly

                            that it is not available at all in a SGEEE system.
                            Furthermore it was wrongly documented that the
                            maxujobs limitation is applied separately to each
                            priority group.

JG-2002-04-22-1: Enhancem.: Improved verbose output in qmake.
                            Start tasks on localhost also per qrsh - slower,
                            but tasks are identifiable in accounting.

JG-2002-04-22-0: Bugfix:    If more then 1 task of a parallel job was started

                            signaling a task was unreliable as the TASK_ID

JG-2002-04-09-0: Enhancem.  Further generalization of the event client

                            - special handling at registration not only for 
                              scheduler but any special event client
                            - make datatypes of enums and use these types 
                              instead of int or u_long32 in access functions
                            - extend event client modify request to allow 
                              changing of the busy state, remove special

                 Bugfix:    At startup qmaster removed pending messages too
                            late (after daemonizing instead of after
                            enrolling).  In rare cases (starting schedd
                            immediately after qmaster daemonized on a fast
                            machine) this could produce an error and cause a
                            delayed registration of the scheduler.

                            the system unusable.
                            Set "no prioritization" as default, behaviour
                            can be changed via env variable
                            SGE_PRIORITY_TAGS.

JG-2002-04-05-1: Cleanup:   removed meanwhile meaningless comments in
                            qlogin_starter module.

CR-2002-04-05-0: Testsuite: - more function parameters for logfile_wait()
                 Enhancem.  - new procedure: close_logfile_wait()

JG-2002-04-05-0: Enhancem.  Further cleanup and enhancement of the
                            event client interface:
                            - general implementation for flushing of events 
                              replaces special handling for scheduler in 
                              qmaster
                            - a new "busy policy" replaces special handling for
                              scheduler with global variables in qmaster
                            - a clientdata field in the event client object is
                              used for checking of orders sequence numbers 
                              instead of using a global variable
                            - lots of additional documentation

                              job id in builtin_starter.c so that job
                              resource limits will work on the SX-6.
                            Added support to control restart timeout
                            delays using environment variables.

                              or submit host
                            - changing event client parameters (subscription or
                              event delivery interval) does not take immediate
                              effect, but a number of changes can be made 
                              effective by a single qmaster communication.

                 Bugtraq:   #4532157

JG-2001-11-26-2: Feature:   Made qconf -secl use the new lHost datatype and
                            access functions (see CR-2001-11-23-1).

AA-2001-11-26-1: Bugfix:    Completion for qmon (-> AH-2001-11-23-1) 

JG-2001-11-26-1: Bugfix:    Fixed a (non critical) read to uninitialized

AH-2001-11-23-1: Bugfix:    Removed unused configuration parameters in queue 
                            configuration and scheduler configuration 
                 Issue:     #71
                 Bugtraq:   #4431000 
                 
                            This requires manual removal of certain parameters before

                            from the scheduler configuration in
                                $SGE_ROOT/default/common/sched_configuration

                            This change is not yet done in qmon but only in
                            the core system. Please don't try to compile
                            qmon until qmon has been updated accordingly
                            (aimk -no-qmon).

AH-2001-11-23-0: Feature:   Enhanced queue priority range to -20 to +20
                            changed data type of queue priority from ulong
                            to string removed priority attribute from queue

CR-2001-11-23-1: Feature:   Implementation of the lHostT cull data type.
                            Modified each cull list where a hostname is
                            stored. The lHostT data type is implemented like
                            the lStringT type, but only used for hostnames.

                            faster handle_vi_edit procedure

AH-2001-11-21-1: Feature:   Added NO_REPRIORIZATION setting in
                            qmaster_params to allow for diabling the PTF
                            module. Without this setting the 'priority'
                            parameter in queue_conf(5) has no effect in a
                            SGEEE system.

JG-2001-11-20-0: Feature:   Generalized event client interface.
                            The former event client interface was very
                            scheduler specific.  Only one event client - the
                            scheduler - could register.  Now any number of
                            event client can register at qmaster and receive
                            events.
                            A sample event client can be found in
                            clients/qevent.  Further cleanup steps and
                            documentation still has to be done.  A
                            subscribe/unsubscribe mechanism does not yet
                            exist.

JG-2001-11-15-0: Feature:   Performance/Scalability optimization: 
                            Defined hash tables on a number of objects to
                            speed up search operations.
                            Changed the order in which non unique hashed
                            objects are stored - some code relies on getting
                            them in the same order they were stored.

JG-2001-11-02-0: qmake: Does not need to export variable PWD when executing 
                        remote tasks (qrsh option -v PWD) - PWD is setup 
                        correctly by execd/shepherd.

CR-2001-10-31-0: Testsuite:

                 qmaster and scheduler - they are no longer needed, 
                 as cull hashing functionality was enabled for job
                 lists.

AH-2001-10-29-0: Qmaster:

CR-2001-10-26-1: Testsuite:
                  - bugfix for path_alias check: problems with file
                    creating on NFS directory. The check will now make
                    sure that the correct/updated path_alias files are 
                    used (diffing file output on each execution host in
                    setup procedure). 

CR-2001-10-26-0: Source: 
                  - Added variable initialization
                  - Removed double defined message

JG-2001-10-25-0: Fixed some memory leaks

JG-2001-10-23-0: Fixed a bug in the implementation of non unique hash tables:
                 The key data has to be duplicated in the hash table.
                 Therefore a duplication function has to be passed when
                 creating a new hash table.

JG-2001-10-22-0: Fixed a memory access error in the cull hash implementation

EB-2001-10-20-0: Added 'const' in libraries

JG-2001-10-18-0: Execd:
                  - bugfix: reporting of a parallel array jobs pe task in
                            tight integration could fail.
                  - use cull hashing iterators for searches in job list          

JG-2001-10-17-0: (Issue #57)
                 Sparc Linux port (32 bit). Grid Engine platform slinux.
                 The port is restricted to SGE as the pdc module had to be 
                 disabled for slinux (aimk variable COMPILE_DC).

JG-2001-10-16-0: Implemented the use of hash tables for cull lists.
                 The list definition (libs/gdi/sge_*L.h) contains information, 
                 for which data fields hash tables shall be generated.
                 Hash tables are created and maintained by the cull list 
                 access functions (lCreateList, lAppendElem etc.) and are used
                 by the cull search functions (lGetElem*).
                 Defined default hash tables for the most used cull lists.
                 Increased the GDI version - the spooling file format and
                 the message format changed.

EB-2001-10-11-1: Changed MAX_SEQNUM from 999,999 to 9,999,999.
                 - changed qstat output format

EB-2001-10-11-0: Changed spool behaviour for (array) jobs
                 - beared down the 32765 subdirectory limit
                 - added some tuning parameters for job spooling
                 - collected duplicated code used in master and execd 

CR-2001-10-10-1: Testsuite:
                 - closed issue # 9 (Create a new test for file parsing)

CR-2001-10-10-0: Testsuite:
                 - new command line option: mfile FILE
                   (don't mail messages, write it to file)
                 - new optional parameter for procedure "wait_for_jobstart"
                   (do a qconf -tsm before waiting for jobstart) 

CR-2001-10-09-2: (sge_rusage.c)
                 - Issue #68 (The accounting file handles only entries < 2048 
                              chars/line)

CR-2001-10-09-1: (rmon_macros.c)
                 - don't use vnsprintf() for ALPHA4 and IRIX6

CR-2001-10-09-0: (parse_job_cull.c)
                 - Issue #67 (long lines in sge_request files causes bus error
                             in qsub)
                 - removed some local char str[1024] definitions and replaced
                   it with error_string buffer one function level above
                 (rmon_macros.c) 
                 - using vnsprintf() system call as default (instead of vsprintf)
                   This should prevent a buffer overflow error
                     
JG-2001-10-09-0: Added statistics for our hashtable implementation that gives
                 following info:
                  - size of hashtable and number of elements stored
                  - number of empty hash chains
                  - maximum and average chain length
                 When a hashtable is resized and log_level is set to log_debug,
                 statistics and profiling information is output to messages 
                 files.

JG-2001-10-08-0: Enabled options -h and -hold_jid for qrsh
                 Bugtraq #4511859

JG-2001-10-04-0: Generalized our hash table implementation to support any
                 data type for keys.
                 Hash table uses hash and compare functions to be specified
                 when a table is created.
                 Hash and compare functions for strings and u_long32 are
                 provided.

EB-2001-10-04-0: (Issue #7)
                 - changed spool behaviour for (array) jobs

AH-2001-10-02-0: Schedd: Moved code handling 'forced' attributes to a section 
                 handling other static matchings. Static matchings can be done
                 independently of consumables/load values and thus needs be done
                 less frequent

SD-2001-10-01-0: Updated the SGEEE pending job algorithm.

                 WARNING - WARNING - WARNING - WARNING - WARNING - WARNING

                 This update changes the binary job structure spooled to disk.  
                 This means that if you are already running with the open source 
                 code, you will need to delete all pending and active jobs before 
                 running with the new SGE binaries. This is true if you are running 
                 either SGE or SGEEE.

CR-2001-09-26-0: Testsuite:
                 - new setup file version

                 - Issue #54 : New test: sge_aliases file  

CR-2001-09-18-0: Testsuite:
                 - sending CR (carriage return) before starting remote command
                   (to stop eventually switched on correct questions) on rlogin
                   call
                 - wait longer before sending password (some login daemons
                   don't accept fast password typing)

CR-2001-09-17-0: Fixed issue #60 "COMMPROC ALLREADY REGISTERED" error

                 array-job being postponed to the follow-up scheduling interval

JG-2001-09-12-0: (Issue #58)
                 - scheduler optimization: sorting of hosts is only done
                   when really necessary.
                 - schedd can output profiling information - set schedd_params
                   to profile
                 - some smaller bugfixes  

AA-2001-09-06-0: Fixed y out of range of allowed Xserver values in QControl
                 This limits the number of displayable qs to 2758

JG-2001-09-03-0: (Issue #51)
                 - PWD was set incorrectly for jobs submitted with qsub -cwd
                   if a path mapping was active (sge_aliases file)
                 - qrsh does no longer use the PWD variable to determine 
                   target job working directory but jobs configuration

CR-2001-08-31-0: Testsuite:
                 - issue #10 shutdown_system_daemon does not work for some platforms

                 and 'Meattr' (Issue# 50)

AA-2001-08-28-0: Fixed task array job handling in qmon submit dialogue (Issue# 48)

EB-2001-08-27-0: Fixed segmentation fault in qstat, qhost, qmon (Issue# 48)
                 - large, fragmented job arrays caused segmentation
                   fault in qstat when the task id range list should be
                   printed

                   (output buffer overflow error). Now the error is only
                   reported in the normal testsuite output. In case of
                   parallel compiling more architectures this error message
                   sometimes appears.
