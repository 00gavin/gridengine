Proceedings of April Grid Engine Workshop</h1></center>

<center>Regensburg, Germany -- April 22-24, 2002</center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p>Hi,
<p>early this year, some groups working on projects related to Grid Engine
suggested that it might be a good idea to create an opportunity for having
a face-to-face meeting. The small meeting, as it was planned originally,
quickly became an impressively sized 3-day workshop with around 35 participants
representing 16 organizations from all over Europe and North America. The
workshop was held from April 22 to April 24 and was hosted at the Sun offices
in Regensburg, Germany.
<p>The workshop covered a wide variety of topics around Grid Computing
in general and Grid Engine in particular. Among the discussed areas were:
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
Grid Computing visions</li>

<li>
Grid Engine project overviews, details and source code insights</li>

<li>
Grid Engine and Grid infrastructures (Globus, OGSA, ...)</li>

<li>
Portal solutions for Grid Engine</li>

<li>
Desired Grid Engine enhancements</li>

<li>
Professinal service solutions for Grid Engine</li>

<li>
... and many more ...</li>
</ul>

<p><br>I'd like to thank all of the participants for their contributions
and the constructive atmosphere which made the workshop such a pleasurable
experience for all of us. It is mainly due to those who have presented
at the workshop that I herewith can announce the availability of proceedings
of the workshop here at the project site.
<p>The proceedings can be found at <a href="http://gridengine.sunsource.net/workshop22-24.04.02/proceedings.html">http://gridengine.sunsource.net/workshop22-24.04.02/proceedings.html</a>.
<p>You will find a list of all participants, the abstracts of the presentations
and links to PDF printouts of the corresponding slides. Also included are
protocols of the special interest group meetings we held on the 3rd workshop
day. Please take a look.
<p>Thanks again to all who have participated and contributed. I'm sure
all attendees join me in my special thanks to Monika Grobecker who has
done an outstanding job in the organization of the workshop and in assembling
the proceedings.
<p>We are convinced that this was not the last event of its kind. We already
have been asked whether we'd be willing to host a follow-up workshop next
year ...
<p>Hope to see you then,
<p>Fritz Ferstl
