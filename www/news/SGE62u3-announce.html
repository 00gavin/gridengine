<h1>What's New</h1>

<p><h3>Amazon Elastic Cloud EC2 Adapter</h3>
The Service Domain Mager (SDM) adds connectivity to Amazon Elastic Cloud EC2
and the ability to flexibly add execution hosts as needed on demand.
</p><br>

<p><h3>Initial Power Saving Support</h3>
A new power saving scheme in SDM enables the creation of a special resource
spare pool in which systems can be powered on or off when added or removed from
this spare pool.
</p><br>

<p><h3>Service Domain Manager (SDM) Simple Install</h3>
It is now possible to install and run an SDM system with only one JVM per
(managed or master) host. Previously, the system was using up to three
separate JVMs per host. This new feature simplifies installation,
configuration and maintenance.
</p><br>

<p><h3>SGE Inspect - Sun Grid Engine Inspect Module</h3>
A new Java based Sun Grid Engine Inspect module allows to monitor SGE
clusters and the Service Domain Manager (SDM).
</p><br>

<p><h3>Exclusive Host Scheduling</h3>
Exclusive host scheduling allows users to request that jobs and parallel
tasks run exclusively on a host if allowed by an administrator.
</p><br>

<p><h3>Microsoft Windows Vista Display Support</h3>
With the release of Sun Grid Engine 6.2u3, the display_win_gui feature is
now fully supported. display_win_gui can now be used to display a job GUI on
the visible Desktop, on both the 32- and 64-bit versions of Windows Vista
(Enterprise and Ultimate Edition), and on Windows Server 2008.

This feature allows a Sun Grid Engine job to request the "display_win_gui"
complex attribute, which launches a GUI on the currently visible Desktop on
the Windows host that displays job information. This works only if the job
is a native Windows application.
</p><br><br>

<p><h3>Changes to licensing</h3>
This Sun Grid Engine version changes the terms under which the software can
be used. Without a valid Sun Grid Engine license, evaluation use is only
permitted for 90 days. The courtesy binaries which will be made available,
will continue to allow unlimited use but will not include the Amazon EC2
adapter and the SGE Inspect modules. The source code of both modules is made
available under the Grid Engine project open source project SISSL license.
