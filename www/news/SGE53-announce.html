<h1>
Grid Engine 5.3 is now ready.</h1></center>

<center>Regensburg, Germany -- April 3, 2002</center>

<p><br>
<p>The developers of the Grid Engine project finished their work for the
Grid Engine 5.3 release.
<p>This release is the first final version of the Grid Engine Open Source
project. This release is fully compatible with Sun Grid Engine 5.3 and
Sun Grid Engine, Enterprise Edition 5.3 (both products will be available
from Sun Microsystems). One Alpha release and two Beta releases preceded
this
<br>version. Ready-to-Install courtesy binaries for various Unix platforms
including documentation and architecture independent files are available
for download.
<p>The software can be installed as "Grid Engine" and "Grid Engine, Enterprise
Edition".
<p>The documentation in PDF format has been updated and is provided in
the documentation package in the courtesy binary download area of the Grid
Engine project site. There are now three manuals available:
<blockquote>Grid Engine Administrator and User Guide
<br>Grid Engine, Enterprise Edition Administrator and User Guide
<br>Reference Manual (for both products)</blockquote>

this release, among them are:
