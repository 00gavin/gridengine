<center><h1>Sun releases three new open source modules to the Grid Engine project</h1>
<br>
SuperComputing 2006 - November 14, 2006
</center>
<p>Sun is making a key contribution to advancing open source technologies by
releasing three modules to the Grid Engine project.</p>

<p>The new Grid Engine Service Domain Management module and two modules with an
existing Sun IP taken from the N1 Grid Engine Product. These are the Grid
Engine Accounting and Reporting Console and the Grid Engine Microsoft
Windows submit and execution host support. Grid Engine is an ideal solution
running on Solaris 10 leveraging Solaris' Dtrace monitors, eliminating
bottlenecks for unmatched grid performance.</p>

<p>Sun will demonstrate the Grid Engine Service Domain Management module that
allows developers to integrate grid-enabled services which then can be
deployed on a pool of shared resources.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Grid Engine Service Domain Management functionality will
dynamically adjust the allocation of resources in order to meet
Service Level Objectives. Reallocating a host resource to another
service may include reprovisioning of the underlying virtual or
actual operating system stack.<sup><small>1</small></sup></p></li>
<li><p>The Grid Engine Accounting and Reporting Console is based upon
standard technology such as Java[tm], SQL, JDBC. Providing source code
access and thus opening up the interfaces will make Grid Engine's
accounting and reporting infrastructure ideally suited for development
projects in new areas opening up new possibilities for utility
computing as a business model in grids operations.</p></li>
<li><p>Furthermore, Sun has the intention to add the Sun proprietary
Microsoft Windows submit and execution host support  at the earliest
feasible point in time to the Grid Engine open source project.</p></li>
</ul>

<sup><small>1</small></sup>The Grid Engine Service Domain Management demo
shows how the Grid Engine software monitors managed services and dynamically
responds to changing workloads. Each service managed by the Grid Engine
Service Domain Management software can be configured with service level
objectives (SLOs) which define that service's desired performance characteristics.
Whenever one of a service's SLOs is violated, the software will attempt to
rectify the violation by reprovisioning and reassigning resources from a pool
of spare resources or from other, less loaded services. This demo will show a
real system responding to changing workloads across two real N1 Grid Engine
grids.
