This release is intended to be a public testing and developer solicitation release.

<p>
The code for this much demanded feature was contributed under the SISSL license by
<a href="http://rsp.com.au">Rising Sun Pictures (RSP)</a>, Australia based feature
film visual effects specialist (e.g. Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings). Special
thanks goes to John Allen (RSP) who did all the hard work of implementing the
changes, to Matthew Landauer (RSP) and John Van Leeuwen (RSP) who wrote the
specification and to Andreas Haas (Sun) who supported RSP during the whole
specification and implementation time. It is planned to add this functionality
to the next major update release of Grid Engine.
