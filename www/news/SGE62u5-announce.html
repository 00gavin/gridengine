<h1>Announcing Sun Grid Engine 6.2 Update 5</h1>
Regensburg, Germany -- December 23, 2009

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
<p>
We are announcing the availability of the Sun Grid Engine 6.2 Update 5
release.

Sun Grid Engine 6.2u5 is a feature update release. We are delivering cloud
connectivity functionality, initial power saving support, add a few much
demanded features and complete the Microsoft Vista support.

<h1>What's New</h1>

<p><h3>Enhanced Inspect</h3>
Sun Grid Engine Inspect is a monitoring and configuration tool that provides
 a flexible interface for viewing current and historical data about your 
Sun Grid Engine cluster(s) and the Service Domain Manager. Inspect now provides 
a new configuration wizard for the Sun Grid Engine Parallel Environment and for 
the Service Domain Manger Cloud Service (EC2) Adapter.
</p><br>

<p><h3>SDM Cloud Service Adapter supports multiple AWS EC2 machine images</h3>
The Cloud Service Adapter provides the ability to expand the cluster size to 
execute jobs on additional cloud hosts provided by the 
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).
It is now possible to extend the local cluster with virtual nodes based on 
different Amazon EC2 AMIs. Furthermore, the user feedback on the actions 
executed on the cloud resources has been improved.
</p><br>

<p><h3>Support for Machine Readable Table Output in SDM</h3>
SDM command line commands now support a machine readable output format. 
This simplifies and eases the integration of SDM and the use of sdmadm commands 
in scripts. See Options for Formatting Table Output for further information.
</p><br>

<p><h3>Slotwise Preemption</h3>
The slotwise preemption allows to configure queue subordinate relationships 
that affect only single slots and not whole queue instances in the subordinated 
queues. Thus, the slotwise preemption provides a means to ensure that high 
priority jobs get the resources they need, while at the same time low priority 
jobs on the same host are not unnecessarily preempted, maximizing the host utilization.
</p><br>

<p><h3>Apache Hadoop support</h3>
This feature allows users to efficiently run Hadoop Map-Reduce jobs in a SGE
cluster. The SGE qmaster is made aware of HDFS data locality and of the data
needs of jobs and will schedule the Hadoop jobs accordingly. After being
assigned to a node by SGE, the actual processing of the job is handed over
to the Hadoop framework.
</p><br>

<p><h3>Topology-aware Scheduling (Job2Core Binding)</h3>
Serial, threaded and parallel jobs can be bound to CPU sockets and cores to
achieve maximum application performance when running under SGE. The new CLI
submission parameter, "-binding", supports a range of binding strategies. The
CPU topology, numbers of sockets, cores and threads available on a machine and
used by jobs is reported as SGE load metrics. This feature is available for
Solaris 10 and OpenSolaris (x64, x86) and Linux (x64, x86) operating systems
which support the CPU core affinity setting and reporting.
</p><br>

<p><h3>Job Submission Verifiers Java[TM] Language Binding (JJSV)</h3>
The server and client side job submission verifier (JSV) has been enhanced
to support JSVs written in the Java programming language.
</p><br>

<p><h3>Array Job Throttling</h3>
Array job throttling enables a user to set a self-imposed limit on the
maximum number of concurrently running tasks per job when submitting jobs
with the new "-tc" CLI submission option. This limit can be altered for
previously submitted jobs. 
</p><br>


<p><h3>Licensing</h3>
For users without a Sun Grid Engine license, a 90 day evaluation use is
offered. The courtesy binaries based on the Grid Engine open source
project will be made available soon.  They will continue to allow unlimited use
but will not include the Amazon EC2 and power saving adapters, the SGE
Inspect module or the Hadoop integration.
