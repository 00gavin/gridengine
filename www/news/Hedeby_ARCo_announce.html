<center><h1>New Grid Engine Open Source Modules Released to the Public</h1>
<p>Regensburg, Germany -- December 13, 2006 </p>
</center>
<br>

<p>As announced at SuperComputing 2006 Sun releases new open source modules to
the Grid Engine project. Today we are going live with the Grid Engine
Service Domain Management module (project Hedeby) and with the Grid Engine
Accounting and Reporting Console (project ARCo). Both projects are written
in the Java programming language.</p>
<ul>

<li><p>
Project Hedeby provides access to a new technology which allows to
dynamically manage resources across so called Service Domains. Service
Domains can be envisioned as autonomous Grids controlled by a resource
manager including but not limited to Grid Engine. Hedeby will adjust
the allocation of resources to individual service domains in order to
meet Service Level Objectives. Reallocating a host resource to another
service domain may include re-provisioning of the underlying virtual or
actual operating system stack. Project Hedeby is still in its early
stages and should be considered work in progress

How to get involved: Have a look at the project home page and the
Javadocs documentation and subscribe to the developer and users mailing
list of project Hedeby.

<li><p>
The Grid Engine Accounting and Reporting Console (ARCo) is based upon
standard technology such as Java[tm], SQL, JDBC. Providing source code
access and thus opening up the interfaces will make Grid Engine's
accounting and reporting infrastructure ideally suited for development
projects in new areas. It will facilitate operational model like
utility computing or will allow to integrate the comprehensive Grid
Engine accounting data into existing reporting tools.  ARCo has been
part of Sun's N1 Grid Engine 6.0 software since 2004.

Project ARCo shares the same mailing lists and Issuezilla as the
Gridengine open source project. Courtesy binaries of ARCo will be made
available under the courtesy binary download link of the Grid Engine
software.
