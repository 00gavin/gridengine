<h1>Announcing Grid Engine 6.2 Beta 2 Binaries<br>


</h1>


Regensburg, Germany -- June 18, 2008
</center>


<p>
Grid Engine 6.2 Beta 2 courtesy binaries are now ready for download.
</p>


<p>
Grid Engine 6.2, which has undergone significant changes in qmaster to
significantly improve its scalability in challenging environments, adds
powerful features to the core system, introduces multi cluster support for
the Accounting and Reporting Console (ARCo) and comes with a new module
extending the scope of Grid Engine to a new domain of use cases: the Service
Domain Manager (SDM), aka. project Hedeby allows to dynamically (re-)assign
computational resources on demand.
</p>


The courtesy binaries are available at<br>

<h4><a name="Service_Domain_Manager"></a>Service Domain Manager</h4>


<p>This release adds a new module, extending the scope of Grid Engine to a new
domain of use cases: The Service Domain Manager (SDM), aka. project Hedeby
will allow to dynamically (re-)assign computational resources on demand
through configurable SLOs (Service Level Objectives), measured by KPIs (Key
Performance Indicators) of the managed resources. Through adapters it will
be possible to add virtually any type of service, be it for example a Grid
Engine cluster, an application server farm, other types of Grid middle ware
applications. Manageable resources can be e.g. physical or virtual hosts,
software licenses.</p>


<p>This release of SDM will support to manage two or more Grid Engine clusters.
Futures releases will add more adapters, add support for GreenIT (manage
spare pools of resources). An integration with Sun's virtualization stacks
is planned.</p>


<p>We welcome the active evaluation, feedback and contribution of our community
to this project. See <a href="http://hedeby.sunsource.net">http://hedeby.sunsource.net</a> for more information and
mailing lists for discussion.</p>

  <ul>

    <li>improved qmaster-execd protocol</li>

  
  </ul>

  
  <ul>

    <li>scheduler running as a thread in qmaster (faster communication
        between qmaster and scheduler threads)&nbsp;</li>

  
  </ul>

  
  <ul>

    <li>improved resource matching in scheduler</li>

  
  </ul>

  
  <ul>

    <li>faster qmaster startup</li>

  
  </ul>

<h4><a name="Moving_Grid_Engine_documentation_set_to"></a>Moving Grid Engine documentation set to <a href="http://wikis.sun.com">http://wikis.sun.com</a></h4>

As one of the first products of Sun Microsystems the entire Grid Engine and<br>

SDM documentation is provided in a wiki on http://wikis.sun.com.<br>

<br>

By open sourcing Sun products, the closed and often slow way of providing<br>

access to documentation to Sun customers and our communities is becoming<br>

less adequate. With Grid Engine being one of Sun's first bigger products<br>

which went open source, we are now taking the next step to modernize, ease<br>

and speedup the access and contribution to our documentation set.<br>

<br>

This enables quicker response to customer feedback (the Wiki provides a<br>

feedback functionality which will be sent directly to the documentation<br>

owners). The Wiki can be opened to interested users to allow directly<br>

updating the content.<br>
