<h3>Audience of this beta program</h3>
This Beta is intended for users who already have experience with the Sun
Grid Engine software or DRM (Distributed Resource Management) systems of
other vendors. This beta adds new features to the SGE 6.2 software. Users
new to DRM systems or users who are seeking a production ready release
should use the Sun Grid Engine 6.2 Update 1 (SGE 6.2u1) release which is
available from:<br><br>

 <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="http://www.sun.com/software/gridware/get_it.jsp">http://www.sun.com/software/gridware/get_it.jsp</a><br><br></div>

For the shipping SGE 6.2u1 release we are offering a free 30 day evaluation
email support.<br>

<h3>Duration of the Beta program and release date</h3>
This beta program lasts until Monday, February 2, 2009. The final release of
Sun Grid Engine 6.2 Update 2 is planned for March 2009.<br><br>

<h3>New functionality delivered with this release</h3>
Sun Grid Engine 6.2 Update 2 (SGE 6.2u2) is a feature update release for SGE
6.2 which adds the following new functionality to the product:

<ul>
   <li>a GUI based installer helping new users to more easily install the
       software. It complements the existing CLI based installation routine</li>
   <li>new support for 32-bit and 64-bit editions of Microsoft Windows Vista
       (Enterprise and Ultimate Edition), Windows Server 2003R2 and Windows
       Server 2008.</li>
   <li>a client and server side Job Submission Verifier (JSV) allows an
       administrator to control, enforce and adjust jobs requests, including
       job rejection. JSV scripts can be written in any scripting language,
       e.g.  Unix shells, Perl or TCL.</li>
   <li>consumable resource attributes can now be requested per job. This makes
       resource requests for parallel jobs much easier to define, especially
       when using slot ranges.</li>
   <li>on Linux, the use of the 'jemalloc' malloc library improves performance
       and reduces memory requirements</li>
   <li>the use of the poll(2) system call instead of select(2) on Linux
       systems improves scalability of qmaster in extremely huge clusters</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h3>Installing SGE 6.2u2 in parallel to a production cluster</h3>
Like with every SGE release it is safe to install multiple Grid Engine
clusters running multiple versions in parallel if all of the the following
settings are different:

<ul>
   <li>&lt;sge_root&gt; directory</li>
   <li>ports (environment variables) for qmaster and execution
     daemons</li>
   <li>unique "cluster name" - from SGE 6.2 the cluster name is
     appended to the name of the system wide startup scripts</li>
   <li>group id range ("gid_range")</li>
</ul>

Starting with SGE 6.2 the Accounting and Reporting Console (ARCo) supports
to accept reporting data from multiple Sun Grid Engine clusters. Following
the installation directions for ARCo and using a unique cluster name for
this beta release there is no risk of losing or mixing reporting data from
multiple SGE clusters.<br>

restrict your questions specific to this Beta release. In case you are
seeking for general evaluation support for the Sun Grid Engine software
please subscribe to the free evaluation support by downloading and using the
