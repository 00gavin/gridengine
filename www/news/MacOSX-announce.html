<h1>
Announcing Grid Engine availability for Mac OS/X</h1></center>

<center>Regensburg, Germany -- November 21, 2003</center>

<p><br>
<p>Grid Engine is now available for the Apple Macintosh operating system
Mac OS/X ("Darwin"). Users from the Grid Engine open source community (among
them Derek Homeier, Ron Chen, William van Etten, Brooks Davis, Greg Wuller
and others)&nbsp; began to port Grid Engine more than two years ago to
Mac OS/X. Since then many sites have run Grid Engine successfully in their
environments.
<p>The generous donation of a development machine from Apple Computer now
makes it possible for Sun Microsystems to add courtesy binary support&nbsp;
for this platform. Binaries for Mac OS/X are now available from the <a href="/project/gridengine/download.html">project
download page. </a>Users who want to access the corresponding source code
need to checkout the CVS tag
<blockquote><b>V53p5_TAG</b></blockquote>
in the branch of the CVS repository
<blockquote><b>V53_beta2_BRANCH</b></blockquote>
A snapshot of the Grid Engine 5.3p5 sources is available as a source tarball
at the&nbsp; <a href="/servlets/ProjectDownloadList">File Exchange Tool</a>
as file <a href="/servlets/ProjectDownloadList?action=download&dlID=77">sge-V53p5_TAG-src.tar.gz</a>.
