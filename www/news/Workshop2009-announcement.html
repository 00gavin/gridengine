<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">The 2009 Grid Engine Workshop this
year is being conducted as part of a larger Sun HPC Software event.
See here for information and registration:</FONT></P>
<P><A HREF="http://hpcworkshop.com/"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">http://hpcworkshop.com/</FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">The workshop has the same format as
in previous years, i.e. 2.5 days of technology, user and solution
provider presentations (please submit your proposals!). It is
augmented by a separate SGE Advanced Seminar prior to the workshop
and by parallel workshop tracks about OpenStorage and Sun Developer
Tools. It also builds on the very successful tradition of having that
workshop in our beautiful and charming city of Regensburg, Germany.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Please register quickly to take
advantage of early bird fees and secure your room at the conference
hotel quickly (limited capacity).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Please also submit your
presentation proposals ASAP to apply for further discounts as speaker
and to make your work known to the Grid Engine community.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">See you in Regensburg in early
September!</FONT></P>
