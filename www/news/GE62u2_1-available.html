<h1>Grid Engine 6.2u2_1 Courtesy Binaries now Available for Download<br>


</h1>

<p>Grid Engine 6.2 Update 2_1 is now ready and courtesy binaries are
available for download. We are also announcing a major reconstruction of the SGE wiki docs
which will lead to better usability and navigation.

SGE 6.2u2_1 is a "feature update" release. We are delivering a few much
demanded features, scalability improvements and memory foot print reductions
in huge HPC clusters, and bug fixes.

Open source courtesy binaries will be made available next week.

<h2>What's new</h2>

<h3>GUI Installer</h3>
Sun Grid Engine 6.2u2_1 comes with a new GUI installer to simplify the
installation process. The GUI installer enables you to easily install a
whole cluster interactively. To install a cluster, you need to set up the
environment in a similar way to an automatic installation.

<h3>Microsoft Windows Vista Support</h3>
New support for 32-bit and 64-bit editions of Microsoft Windows Vista
(Enterprise and Ultimate Edition), Windows Server 2003R2 and Windows Server
2008.

<h3>Job Submission Verifiers (JSVs)</h3>
JSVs allow users and administrators to define rules that determine which
jobs are allowed to enter into a cluster and which jobs should be rejected
immediately. A JSV is a script or binary that can be used to verify, modify,
or reject a job during the time of job submission or on the master host.

<h3>Consumable Resources Per Job</h3>
Consumable complex attributes can now be configured as per job. Such
consumables are consumed as requested and are no longer multiplied by the
requested slots. This makes resource requests for parallel jobs much easier
to define, especially when using slot ranges.

<h3>jemalloc Library</h3>
Linux distributions (x64 platforms) come with a default memory allocator
library which is not as efficient as the open source jemalloc memory
allocator library also used by the Firefox browser. SGE 6.2 Update 2_1
replaces the native Linux malloc library with the jemalloc library. This has
a positive effect on the master host performance in large and high
throughput Sun Grid Engine clusters on Linux and reduces the memory
footprint up to 20%. This will lead to a significant performance increase.
<br>
Jason Evans developed jemalloc for use in FreeBSD where it was included in the 7.0
release.
