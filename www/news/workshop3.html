Proceedings of 3rd Grid Engine Workshop</h1></center>

<center>Regensburg, Germany -- September 10-12, 2007</center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p>
On September 10th-12th, 2007, users and developers of the Sun Grid Engine product and Grid Engine open source project converged on Regensburg, Germany to share information, experiences, ideas, and plans at the Sun Grid Engine Workshop 2007.  Participants came from across the globe and a wide variety of organizations, from research groups to ISVs, from customers to consultants.

<p>
We understand that not all of you were able to attend the Workshop. Despite extending the room capacity to its maximum, the event was oversubscribed quickly so we had to turn many of you down. We hope we'll be able to welcome you in one of the follow-on events which many attendees have suggested to take place frequently and in alternating geographical locations.
</p>
<p>
This year, the main themes were real-world applications of Sun Grid Engine, clever extensions and integrations with the current product versions, and what to expect from future product versions, especially the upcoming 6.2 release.  The conference concluded with an open discussion about the direction of the product and the features that the community finds most important.
</p>
<p>
The Grid Engine team would like to extend a warm thank you to all of the workshop participants, and especially to the session presenters.  The strength of the Grid Engine community is one of the most compelling "features" of the product.

<p>
Again, thank you sincerely to all participants for making the Sun Grid Engine Workshop 2007 an outstanding success!  We hope you enjoyed it, and we hope to see you at the next workshop.
