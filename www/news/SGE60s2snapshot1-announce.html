<h1>Announcing Grid Engine 6.0 Scalability Update 2 Snapshot 1<br>
</h1>
</center>
<center>Regensburg, Germany -- Sep 19, 2005</center>
<p>Grid Engine 6.0 Scalability Update 2 Snapshot 1 is now ready and courtesy binaries are
available for download. The SGE 6.0s2snapshot1 release includes performance improvents 
and fixes bugs of the software, installation procedure and man pages. This release is aimed 
for testing purposes only and not for productive clusters. <br>
</p>
<p>The major scalability improvements are:
<ul>
   <li>qmaster GDI GET request handling (e.g. qstat) is now faster and consumes less memory.
   <li>async communication protocol between scheduler and master. This leads to a more 
efficient communication flow.
   <li>better commlib thread concurrency through introduction of RW-locks.
   <li>significantly enhanced DRMAA submission rate.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Some important fixes included in this release are:
<ul>
   <li>Issue 1628 - Problem with large job output files on 32-bit Linux nodes
   <li>Issue 1665 - delivery of queue based signals to execd repeated endlessly
   <li>Issue 1780 - qconf -mq disallows 2057 hostspecific profiles in slots configuration
   <li>Issue 1787 - calendar syntax "week  mon=0-21" corrupts SGE and may crash qmaster
</ul>
A complete list of fixed problems is available at<br>
