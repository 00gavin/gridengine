        <h1>JOb Scheduling Hierarchically (JOSH) - Going Global with Globus V3 and Grid Engine</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>

	<p>
        JOSH (JOb Scheduling Hierarchically) is a multi-site
        job-management tool built on top of the <a
        href="http://www.globus.org/">Globus Toolkit</a> and <a
        href="http://gridengine.sunsource.net/">Grid Engine</a>. A
        JOSH user interface (or client) allows the submission,
        monitoring and termination of jobs running on Grid Engines at
        remote compute sites (the servers). JOSH also handles the
        transfer of data files and executables to and from jobs.
	</p>

	<p>
        The JOSH software employs a hierarchical scheduler to match a
        user's job requirements against Grid Engine instances at
        available compute sites. It can then forward the job to the
        chosen compute site for local scheduling and execution.
	</p>

	<p>
        A middleware layer handles secure communications and data
        transfer between the hierarchical scheduler and Grid Engine
        and any remote data sources. The OGSA-compliant Globus Toolkit
        version 3 forms this layer.
	</p>


	<p>
        JOSH has been developed by the <a
        href="http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/sungrid/">EPCC Sun Data and
        Compute Grids project</a>. The project partners are the UK
        National e-Science Centre, represented in this project by
        EPCC, and Sun Microsystems. This project also developed the <a
        href="http://gridengine.sunsource.net/project/gridengine/tog.html">Transfer-queue
        Over Globus (TOG)</a>. TOG allows an enterprise to access
        remote compute resources via their existing Grid Engine
        installation.
	</p>


        <h2>Background</h2>

	<p>
	Grid Engine allows the efficient use of compute resources
        within an organisation. However there is some desirable Grid
        functionality that Grid Engine does not provide.  Grids can be
        classified at three different levels.
	</p>

	<ul>
	    <li>
	    Cluster Grid - a single team or project and their associated resources.
	    </li>

	    <li>
            Enterprise Grid - multiple teams and projects but within a
            single organisation, facilitating collaboration of
            resources across the enterprise.
	    </li>

	    <li>
	    Global Grid - linked Enterprise and Cluster Grids,
            providing collaboration amongst organisations.
            </li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	Grid Engine meets the first two levels by allowing a user to
	transparently make use of any number of compute resources
	within an organisation. However, Grid Engine, alone does not
	yet meet the third level.
        </p>


	<p>
	The Globus Toolkit is essentially a Grid API for connecting
	distributed compute and instrument resources. Integration with
	Globus allows Grid Engine to meet this third level.  That is,
	it allows collaboration amongst enterprises. The JOSH software
	integrates Grid Engine V5.3 and Globus Toolkit V3 to provide a
	user with this access to remote resources.  This allows user
	jobs to be scheduled across a global grid.
	</p>


	<h2>Download</h2>

	<p>
        The <a href="http://gridengine.sunsource.net/download/TOG/user-guide.pdf">JOSH User Guide</a> describes the
        use of the JOSH 1.0 command-line client tool known as
        hiersched. The <a href="http://gridengine.sunsource.net/download/TOG/client-install.pdf">JOSH Client Install Guide</a> and
        the <a href="http://gridengine.sunsource.net/download/TOG/server-guide.pdf">JOSH Server Install Guide</a> describe the
        installation of the JOSH client and server software
        respectively.
	</p>

	<p>
        Currently the JOSH software can only be downloaded as a binary
        archive.
	</p>

	<ul>
	    <li>JOSH 1.0 Client Binary Archive: <a href="http://gridengine.sunsource.net/download/TOG/josh-1.0-client-bin.tar.gz">josh-1.0-client-bin.tar.gz</a></li>
	    <li>JOSH 1.0 Server Binary Archive: <a href="http://gridengine.sunsource.net/download/TOG/josh-1.0-server-bin.tar.gz">josh-1.0-server-bin.tar.gz</a></li>
	</ul>

	<p>
        The client binary archive contains JOSH client binaries, the
        User Guide and the Client Install Guide. The server binary
        archive contains JOSH server binaries, the Server Install
        Guide and the JOSH limitations document. The JOSH <a
        href="http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/sungrid/PUB/D4_1-FunctionalSpecification.pdf">Functional
        Specification</a> and <a
        href="http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/sungrid/PUB/D4_2-JOSHSystemsDesign.pdf">System
        Design</a> are available separately.
	</p>

    <p>
        The JOSH source will be released with the next version of
        JOSH, see <a href="#future_developments">Future
        Developments</a>.

	<h2><a name="future_developments">Future Developments</a></h2>

	<p>
        The EPCC Sun Data and Compute Grids team are currently working
        on a future release of JOSH. In this next release the
        hierarchical scheduler is expected to contain functionality
        for identifying sites with best access to the required data
        sources for a user's job.
	</p>

	<p>
        The next release of JOSH is due in March 2004.
