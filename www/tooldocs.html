<H3><font color="#990000">CVS and hosted tools</font></H3>

<P>This site features the following hosted tools for project members. Each of the following links leads to further documentation about using these tools.

<p>You can use CVS to access the Grid Engine source code. You need to have a CVS client. Most Linux machines by default, have the command-line client
installed. You might also want to visit the 
<A HREF="http://www.cvshome.org/">CVS Web site</A>, which <A HREF="http://www.cvshome.org/dev/codes.html">lists</A> the available CVS clients for different
platforms, their strengths, and weaknesses.
You also need to read the Cederqvist manual that  includes most CVS clients that are used for general information. Tips on this page will assume
command-line usage on UNIX&reg; using Bourne shell.
