     <P>Mailing lists provide a way for developers on a project to
     communicate with one another and to receive notifications of
     project events. In general, the way mailing lists work depends
     upon the type of project:

<ul>

<li>Open source project mailings lists are open to any subscriber,
although project owners can choose to limit who may subscribe and post
to certain lists.
<p>

<li>Proprietary project mailing lists are always private, that is,
limited only to approved subscribers who are usually project members.

</ul>

<P>In either case, all project mailing lists are created with <A
HREF="http://anzu.tigris.org/">anzu</A>, an open source mail alias and
list management extension of qmail simple mail transfer protocol
(smtp). Anzu supports multiple domains, enabling each project to
define and manage its own unique set of mailing lists for the project
domain.

<P>Every standard development project is created with the following set of default lists:

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <DL>
	<DT><span class="InputHeader">dev@PROJECTNAME.domain.com</span> 

        <DD>The main list for developers to discuss specific project
        development issues and requirements for version control in the
        project.
<P>
	<DT><span class="InputHeader">cvs@PROJECTNAME.domain.com</span> 
        <DD>Automated notifications of file version control changes and discussion of those changes.
<P>
        <DT><span class="InputHeader">announce@PROJECTNAME.domain.com</span> 
        <DD>Announcements of new releases and other major project events.
<P>
	<DT><span class="InputHeader">issues@PROJECTNAME@domain.com</span>
	<DD>Automated notifications and discussions of the project's
	reported issues (defects, enhancements, features, tasks, and
	patches) and changes made to issues, such as reassignment,
	comments, or resolution.
<P>
        <DT><span class="InputHeader">users@PROJECTNAME.domain.com</span> 
        <DD>A more general discussion list for the project's end users.
    </DL>
    </BLOCKQUOTE> 

	<P>Discussion-only projects are set up with one mailing list initially.

	<P>Default lists for each project are "top-level" mailing
	lists. If traffic relating to a particular module or component
	becomes too high for a particular top-level list, the project
	owner can create a separate mailing list to splinter off the
	discussion.

	<P>Most lists also have a corresponding "digest" version --
	subscribers to the digest list receive a single message per
	day with all of that day's postings.

     <P><span class="InputHeader"><A NAME="mailfeatures">Mailing list features</A></span> 
     <P>The default, customary mailing list features are: 
     <UL>
     <LI>list subscribe/unsubscribe
     <LI>digest subscribe/unsubscribe   
     <LI>post a message
     <LI>get help
     <LI>view the archive
     </UL>

     <P>These generic list options are generated for every project
     mailing list. Project owners can modify these default mailing
     lists, add new lists, delete unnecessary lists, add and remove
     subscribers, add and remove moderators, and set other mailing
     list parameters. <a href="#mailadmin">See mailing list
     administration</A>.

     <P>For instructions on using the mailing lists for a particular
     project, first click on the name of the project at left, then
     select "Mailing List" in the Project Resources tool bar.

    <P><span class="InputHeader"><A NAME="mailarchives">Mailing list archives</A></span>

     <P>Project/component mailing list archiving is handled by <A
     HREF="http://eyebrowse.tigris.org/">eyebrowse</A>, a brand new
     open source tool that stores and indexes list messages, providing
     multiple options for browsing, reading, and searching mailing
     list archives via a web browser. Beyond storing messages,
     eyebrowse adds a database, and text indexing engine to handle
     rapid message search and retrieval.

	<P><B><I>To view archives for a mailing list</I></B>, first
	click on the project in the list, then select the "Mailing
	List" option in the Project Resources tool bar to see a list
	of all mailing lists for that project. Click on the <I>View
	Archive</I> link next to the list you want to view.

     <P>The default view for browsing mailing list archives is by date
     summary. Other summary views available are: by author, by
     subject, and by thread. You can also do text string searches of
     archived messages using simple Boolean operators.

<P><span class="InputHeader"><A NAME="mailadmin">Mailing list administration</A></span>

	<P>Project owners customize project mailing lists in the
	Mailing List Edit screen, accessed by clicking the <I>Project
	Edit</I> link on the Project Home page. Mailing list links at
	the bottom of the page display an edit screen for each list.

	<P>Project owners establish mailing list management policies by configuring two important aspects of project
mailing lists: 

	<DL>
	<DT><b>Subscription moderation</b> 
        <DD>Subscriptions to each
	mailing list can either be open or on an approval
	basis. Subscriptions to proprietary project mailing lists are
	moderated by default because these lists are always
	private. Open source project owners can specify moderated
	subscriptions for certain mailing lists if desired.
<p>
	<DT><b>Posting policy</b>
	<DD>Mailing lists can be configured to handle message posts at three different levels:
		<ul>
		<li>"<B>Discuss</B>" allows subscribers to post, and moderates posts (requires approval) from others.
		<li>"<B>Announce</B>" moderates <I>all</I> posts.
		<li>"<B>Automated-notification</B>" allows anyone to post messages without moderation.
		</ul>
	</DL>

	<P>As part of the configuration options for all lists, a footer in the every message with subscribe/unsubscribe
instructions can be turned on or off.

<!--
	<P>Other pre-set mailing list features include:
<ul>
<li>Indexing 
<li>Archiving 
<li>List digest setup
*** <li>No archive guards, enabling any user to retrieve archived list messages in the case of open mailing lists.
*** <li>Public          = true (the list will respond to admin commands like
                        subscribe)

*** <li>request_address = true (makes life easier for people who are used to majordomo)
*** <li>Remote administration, allowing list moderators to subscribe people to the list via e-mail  (other useful
things***)
</ul>

	<p>Discussion lists include two addition features when the posting policy is set for either "announce" or
"automated-notification":

<ul>
***<li>Message "extras" are disallowed, stripping messages of certain mime types.
***<li>Posted message size restrictions requiring messages to be a minimum of 2 bytes and a maximum of 400 kb. This
restriction is not applied to the other types of mailing lists by default but can be set up through domain level
administration.
</ul>
