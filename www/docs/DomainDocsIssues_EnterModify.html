       <P><B><I>Defect</I></B> is a problem with an existing feature
       that is either not developed to spec or does not work as
       designed. These are often referred to as "bugs."

       <P><B><I>Enhancement</I></B> is an improvement to an existing
       feature.

       <P><B><I>Feature</I></B> is an addition to the software to add
       a piece of functionality that does not yet exist.

       <P><B><I>Task</I></B> is an activity to be done on behalf or in
       support of a feature or enhancement. Tasks do not typically
       require direct changes to the code base.

       <P><B><I>Patch</I></B> is a special kind of issue, a section of
       code to be applied or attached to existing software, often to
       fix a defect.

      <P>

      <DT><SPAN CLASS="InputHeader">Initial state</SPAN>

       <DD>Newly entered issues are either "new" or "unconfirmed."
       Marking an issue <A
       HREF="/project/gridengine/docs/issues_unconfirmedhelp.html">unconfirmed</A> means
       you have not yet determined whether it is true or valid. Read
       more about "state" in the <A
       HREF="/project/gridengine/docs/issue_lifecycle.html">lifecycle of an issue</A>.


       <P>
       <DT><A NAME="assigned_to"><SPAN CLASS="InputHeader">Assigned To</SPAN></A>

        <DD>Enter the email address of the one individual who is in
        charge of resolving the issue. If this field is left blank,
        the issue by default is assigned to the component/sub
        component owner. Every time this field changes, the status
        changes to <B>NEW</B> to make it visible in the assignee's
        list of issues.

       <DT><P><SPAN CLASS="InputHeader">Cc:</SPAN>

	<DD>Add email addresses of other individuals who need email
	notification when this issue changes status or when there is
	other activity on this issue. Delimit multiple email
	addressees by single spaces only -- no commas or semi-colons
	are necessary.

       <P>Note: Assign cc addresses sparingly. Project participants
       whose interest or involvement in this issue is peripheral
       should be encouraged to use IssueZilla to check and track
       issues rather than to rely on automatic email notification.

       <P>
       <DT><SPAN CLASS="InputHeader">URL</SPAN>
        <DD>How to use this field depends on the issue type:
       <P>
       <UL>
        <LI>For defects, URL should lead to a fairly stable system where the the problem is obvious or can be easily
reproduced.
        <LI>For enhancements, URL should provide details pertaining to the improvement, such as mockups.
        <LI>For features, URL should link to any web-based form of material explaining the improvement such as mockups or
design specs.
        <LI>For tasks, URL is optional and may include linking to the associated feature or enhancement.
       </UL>
       <P>
       <DT><SPAN CLASS="InputHeader">Summary</SPAN>
        <DD>A terse, specific statement to describe this issue. This should a few unique, self-explanatory words to
identify this issue easily in reports and short lists. Limiting your entry to the width of the field is best for the
columnar display of query results.
       <P>
       <DT><SPAN CLASS="InputHeader">Description</SPAN>
        
       <DD>Provide a full description of the issue including any
       pertinent history or activity around this issue. Because this
       field is additive, it serves as the knowledge base and means of
       communicating through this issue's life cycle. Other project
       participants view and add comments or information using this
       field.

Writing Guidelines</A>.

    <P><A NAME="editissue"><SPAN CLASS="InputHeader">Viewing and modifying issues</SPAN></A>

    <P>Existing issues may be accessed in two different ways:
    <UL>

     <LI>Entering a specific issue number in the "Find" field located
     in the IssueZilla tool bar displays the "Issue View" page.

     <LI>Querying for issues either by clicking the "Query database"
     button in the Project Issues page, or by clicking the "Query"
     link in the IssueZilla tool bar displays an "Issue List" page of
     your results. (See <A
     HREF="/project/gridengine/docs/DomainDocsIssues_Query.html">Querying and tracking
     issues"</A>.)
    </UL>

    <P>The Issue View page is similar to the Issue Entry page and contains many of the same fields, but there are several
important additions:

    <P>
    <DL>
     <DT><SPAN CLASS="InputHeader">Target Milestone</SPAN>

      <DD>If your project has designated milestones, this field can be
      used to associated issues with those milestones, such as version
      releases. A milestone plan enumerates when different features
      are expected to be completed. If an issue has a target date or
      version release, this means the work on this issue must be
      completed by that date. This field should only be set or changed
      by the person responsible for the issue.
     <P>

     <DT><SPAN CLASS="InputHeader">Add/Remove CC:</SPAN>

      <DD>You can add additional email addresses to this issue to
      alert other project members when activity occurs on this
      issue. If you are adding multiple addresses, delimit these with
      single spaces; do not use commas or semi-colons. You can also
      <I>remove</I> one or more email address listed by selecting it
      and checking the "Remove selected Cc's" box below.
     <P>
     <DT><SPAN CLASS="InputHeader">QA Contact</SPAN> 
    
     <DD>This field should contain an email address or alias for the
     person(s) responsible for quality control of this issue.
     <P>

     <DT><SPAN CLASS="InputHeader">URL</SPAN> 
     <DD>If this field is populated, clicking the field label links
     directly to the designated URL.
     <P>

     <DT><SPAN CLASS="InputHeader">Status Whiteboard</SPAN>

      <DD>The purpose of this generic field can be user-defined and
      project-specific. (In BugZilla, this field is used for writing
      short, one-line notes about the bug.)
     <P>

     <DT><SPAN CLASS="InputHeader">Attachments</SPAN>

      <DD>Adding attachment to an issue can be very useful. For
      defects, appending test cases, screen shots and/or editor logs
      to the issue can help pinpoint the problem to help the developer
      reproduce it.

     <P> 

     <P>For features, enhancements, and tasks, you can attach screen
     shots, mockups, and other files to provide supplemental
     information to illustrate the issue.

     <P>You can also use this field to attach a patch related to the
     issue when appropriate. Read more about <A
     HREF="/project/gridengine/docs/contributing_patches.html">contributing patches</A>.
    
     <P>
     <DT><SPAN CLASS="InputHeader">Dependencies</SPAN>
      
     <DD>When an issue can't be addressed until one or more other
     issues are resolved, these are dependencies. Each issue can have
     other issues it depends upon , as well as issues that depend upon
     it, that is, other issues that this issue "blocks" while being
     unresolved. The links next to these fields display a tree and
     graph illustrating the dependencies associated with the issue
     currently being viewed.
     <P>



     <DT><SPAN CLASS="InputHeader">Vote for this issue</SPAN> 
      <DD>
<!-- (adapted from bugzilla.mozilla.org's "Bugzilla Voting" page) -->

IssueZilla's "voting" feature allows project members to have a certain
number of votes in their project to use toward issues. Project owners
set the number of votes allowed per issue, as well as the number of
votes allowed per member. Some projects/components may not allow any,
which means you can't vote on those issues at all. Your vote indicates
which issues you believe are the most important to be addressed.
     
<P>
You may vote for the same bug more than once, however, you have a
limited number of total votes allocated to you. You can either vote
once for many issues, or use multiple votes for a fewer issues that
you think are particularly critical.

<P>
If an issue has received votes, the total number appears next to
"Votes for this issue", or "0" if no votes have been logged. Clicking
on this number displays the Show Votes page. If there are votes, names
and their associated number of votes are listed.

<P>
To view a list of issues that have received votes, use the IssueZilla
Query page, and enter the numeral "1" in the "At least ___ votes"
field. This returns issues in your query results with at least one
vote.

     <P>To vote for an issue: 
     <UL>

      <LI>Open the issue (using the "Find" link in the tool bar or by
      clicking the issue from a list or report).

      <LI>Click on the "Vote for this issue" link just above the
      "Additional Comments" field. (If no such link appears, then
      voting may not be allowed for this issue's project/component.)

      <LI>Indicate the number of votes you want to log for this
      issue. This page also displays how many votes you've given to
      other bugs, allowing you may reallocate your votes as necessary.

      <LI>You receive automatic email notification anytime changes
      occur on issues you have voted for.

      <LI>You may review your votes at any time by clicking the
      "Change your password or preferences" link in the IssueZilla
      tool bar or at the bottom of the query page.

     </UL>
     <P>

     important role of <A

     voting in open source projects</A>.
     <P>

     <DT><SPAN CLASS="InputHeader">Groups</SPAN> 
     <DD>If one or more drop boxes appear identifying project-defined
     groups to be included in or excluded from viewing an issue, this
     indicates that the project/component owner has created groups
     within the project. You should contact this person to determine
     how to use these fields.
     <P>

     <DT><SPAN CLASS="InputHeader">Leave as NEW/ASSIGNED</SPAN>
      <DD>If you are viewing an issue with the status NEW but it is
      not assigned to you, leave this default as checked. When the
      issue <I>is</I> assigned to you, you should accept it by
      checking "Accept issue."
     <P>

     <DT><SPAN CLASS="InputHeader">Resolve issue</SPAN> 
      <DD>Once an issue is resolved, this is where to designate the
      type of resolution. Changing an issue to "Resolved" means that
      as far as the assignee is concerned, this issue is completed. <A
      HREF="/project/gridengine/docs/issue_lifecycle.html#resolvedissues">Read more</A>
      about the multiple options in this field's pull-down
      menu. <B>Note: Changing an issue's status to FIXED signals all
      other project members that any source file changes associated
      with this issue have been checked into the CVS repository.</B>
     <P>

     <DT><SPAN CLASS="InputHeader">Reassign</SPAN>
      <DD>The person responsible for the issue can be changed here by
      entering a new email address, or reassigned to the component/sub
      component owner.
     <P>

     <DT><SPAN CLASS="InputHeader">View Issue Activity</SPAN>
      <DD>This link displays a snapshot page of changes made to an issue.
     <P>

     <DT><SPAN CLASS="InputHeader">Format For Printing</SPAN>
      <DD>This links redisplays the Issue View in a format for printing out. 

     <P>
     <DT><SPAN CLASS="InputHeader">Commit</SPAN>
      <DD>This button saves any modifications made to this
      issue. <B>Caution! When viewing an issue, the "Enter" key works
      like the <I>Commit</I> button. Any modifications you may have
      made (accidentally or otherwise) are saved and the issue's
      assignee and cc list receive email notification of activity on
      this issue.</B>

     <P><B><I>To exit out of viewing this issue without making any
     changes</I></B>, use the links at the top of this page or in the
     IssueZilla tool bar to view other issues, or the <I>Back</I>
     button in your browser. Even when you have changed fields, as
     long as you do not use the <I>Commit</I> button or the "Enter"
     key, the issue remains unchanged in the database.
     <P>

     <DT><SPAN CLASS="InputHeader">Reset</SPAN>
      <DD>Returns all fields to their <I>previously committed</I> values.
