<p><a name="thisguide"></a><span class="InputHeader">About this Guide</span></p>

<p><i><b>What this guide discusses</b></i>. The purpose of this
discussion is to provide a guide for users to tunnel to the desired
server using SSH (Secure Shell).

<p><b><i>What this guide does not discuss</i></b>. This guide does not
explain how to use CVS, only how to set up the tunnel so that you can
use CVS. However,a brief description of the command to begin using
CVS, once the tunnel has been established, is appended at the end of
this document.



<p><a name="aboutssh"></a><span class="InputHeader">About SSH</span>



<p>SSH is a flexible and more secure replacement for telnet and
rlogin. It is widely used in development projects to provide access
control and data-transport security. SSH can be used to create an
unobtrusive, transparent "port tunnel" to the CVS (concurrent versions
system) server. Data sent through the tunnel is encrypted, but the
process is invisible to you or to the client software you are using to
access the CVS repository. <p>Because it is easy to use and very
secure, we recommend SSH for developers accessing the CVS repository.

<ul> 

<li>Accessing the CVS repository without SSH runs the very real risk
of having a third-party thief snoop your CVS password. And, with your
CVS password, the thief can wreak serious mischief. For instance, he
or she might quite plausibly compromise the CVS repository by
inserting a virus in the source code. 
</li> 
</ul>

<p><a name="concepts"></a><span class="InputHeader">Concepts</span></p>

<ul>

<li>Using the right software</li>

<li>Establishing an SSH tunnel</li>

</ul>

<p>Before you can establish an SSH connection, you have to find the
right software,i.e., a client that places a terminal on your desktop,
if you are using Windows or Mac OS 9 (Mac OS X has SSH built
in). Fortunately, there are several excellent clients (both free and
not) that offer Windows and Mac OS users desktop terminals. The
section below discusses them in detail. Of course, if you are using
Linux (or some other Unix variant), then you can skip that section and
go right to the section, <a href="#HowtoConnect">"Tunneling Using
Cygwin,"</a> that describes the key elements in establishing an SSH
tunnel in a Unix-like environment.
</p>

<p>Once you have obtained a client terminal, the process of
establishing a tunnel to the server housing the CVS repository is
fairly simple. The crucial element is making sure you connect to the
right server and that you use the right port numbers in establishing
your tunnel. Fortunately, that number has been standardized: 2401.</p>

<p></p>

<p><a name="choosing"></a><span class="InputHeader">Choosing the Desktop Terminal</span></p>

<p><b>Platforms</b> 

<p><b>Linux, Unix, Solaris.</b> Linux supports SSH. To connect using
SSH, see the "Tunneling Using Cygwin" section below. </p>

<p><b>Macintosh.</b>In important regards, procedures for tunneling
with a Mac client terminal resemble those for Windows clients. Mac
users can download and install any number of free or for-fee
terminals, the most popular being <a
href="http://www.macssh.com">MacSSH,</a> which is characteristically
easy to use, is free, and offers superior performance for SSH1
connections. <a
href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~jonasw/freeware/niftyssh/">

<p>NiftyTelnet 1.1 SSH</a>, a fast and easy-to-use telnet and SSH1 client is also free. It supports effortless scp (secure
copying), as well. 

<p>Mac OS X, based on FreeBSD and the Mach 3 kernel, has SSH built in
and is constantly updated. You can also obtain and use <a
href="http://www.DataFellows.com">Data Fellows' F-Secure SSH,</a> a
for-fee (see below) client create a desktop terminal allowing you to
tunnel to the CVS server. F-Secure SSH can be obtained at:
http://www.DataFellows.com. For SSH1, you will want F-Secure SSH
v.1.02; v.2.1 is for SSH2 connections only--i.e., those requiring
encrypted certificates, or keys.</p>



<p><b>Windows</b>. If you are using Windows (NT or 9x or 2K), then you
can use <a href="http://www.vandyke.com/">SecureCRT</a>, <a
href="http://www.DataFellows.com">F-Secure SSH</a>, or <a
href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>. Cygwin, from Cygnus
Solutions, provides a nearly full Unix environment on your desktop.

<p>In contrast, SecureCRT and F-Secure SSH only provide user-friendly
terminals, i.e., they don't pretend to emulate a Unix
environment. Both F-Secure SSH and SecureCRT cost money ($100 for
SecureCRT, $150 for F-Secure SSH), although a free, 30-day trial
version is available for each. Of all, Cygwin has the added value of
not just being free and very powerful, but also open source and
constantly improved upon. </p>

<li><a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~jonasw/freeware/niftyssh/">NiftyTelnet SSH</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Both Mac clients offer intuitive interfaces; both also are
well-documented. For that reason, this discussion of the Mac clients
is very brief. However, for both clients, the important information is
the same as for the Windows clients: the hostname and ports must be
correctly specified.</p>


<a name="windows"></a><p><b>Windows</b>

<p>Two free clients for Windows provide SSH tunneling:

<ul>

<li><a href="http://www.zip.com.au/~roca/ttssh.html">TTSSH</a>, an
open-source add-on to Tera Term Pro

<li><a
href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a>, a
free implementation of Telnet and SSH for Win32 platforms. It also
provides an XTerm terminal emulator.

</ul>

<p>As with the Mac clients, the important things to keep in mind are
the hostname and the port numbers. For both terminals, the
configuration process is straightforward. Because TTSH is an add-on to
Tera Term, it means you have to go through that one extra step before
SSH functionality is possible. [A fuller description of tunneling with
TTSH is being drafted and will be posted when finished. For now,
please see TTSH's 
<a href="http://www.zip.com.au/~roca/ttssh.html">website</a>.]

<p>PuTTY, on the other hand, does not allow you to easily configure
the client to handle port forwarding. As a result, it is not
recommended for tunneling.


<p><b>SecureCRT and F-Secure SSH</b></p>

<p>Both these clients are fairly easy to use and configure for SSH1
tunneling. The information you will need--doubtless familiar by
now--is listed below.</p>


<p>The following illustrates the procedure; we will use SecureCRT (version 3.1.2):
<ol>

<li>Open a new session, specifying "SSH1" in the pull-down menu.</li>

<li>For "Hostname," enter the name of this site.</li>

<li>Click on the "Advanced" button by "Hostname."</li>

<li>Once in the Advanced section, click on the "Port Forwarding" tab.</li>

<li>For "Local port," enter "<span class="TypewriterPlain">2401</span>."</li>

<li>For "Remote port" enter "<span class="TypewriterPlain">2401</span>."</li>

<li>For Username, enter "<span class="TypewriterPlain">tunnel</span>."</li>

<li>For User password, enter "<span class="TypewriterPlain">tunnel</span>."

<li>For "Remote hostname," enter "<span class="TypewriterPlain">localhost</span>."</li>

<li>Enter "Save" and "OK" to exit the dialog box.</li>

<li>Back in the main connection page. . . .</li>

<li>Leave the defaults for "Cipher" and "Authentication" as they are.</li>

<li>Click on "Connect."</li>

<li>The server should then prompt for your password. It is "<span
class="TypewriterPlain">tunnel</span>."</li>

<li>If this is your first time, the client will tell you that no "host
key" for the server has been found and ask if you want to
continue. You want to continue.</li>

<li>You are now tunneling.</li>

<li>The terminal screen does not show a prompt. That's how it should
be. The tunnel has been established. You are now ready to begin using
CVS securely.</li>

</ol>



<p><b>Cygwin</b></p>

<p>The most important consideration for installing Cygwin is creating
the appropriate Unix folders. Cygwin's <a
href="http://www.cygwin.com/">website</a> offers complete and detailed
instructions; the below is an abbreviated version.</p>

<ul>

<li>Download and install Cygwin. Cygnus gives you the option of
installing from the Web, but it is faster (and ultimately more
efficient) to install from a local disk. So just download and save the
file somewhere you can easily find it.</li>

<li>Click on Cygwin's "setup.exe" icon and follow the instructions,
accepting the defaults. At some point, you will be asked for text
format and whether you want Cygwin to be for yourself alone or to be
shared. It doesn't matter whether you choose DOS or Unix, but for the
sake of ease of use, choose Unix and "All." Cygwin will then install,
and should create icons in your start file as well as on your
desktop. If it doesn't, run setup again. Nothing will be installed if
nothing needs to be, but it will take you to the end, where you can
check the boxes indicating you want the icons installed. Check
them.</li>

<li>At this point, you need to create the Unix folders. You can create
the standard directories from within Cygwin, as Cygwin's configuration
instructions suggest (<a
href="http://www.cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/setup-dir.html">http://www.cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/setup-dir.html</a>),
or you can set them up from within Windows. Using the Windows method
has some advantages, especially for people who are not entirely
familiar with Unix commands and protocols. Since Cygwin is able to
read both Win32 (Windows) file paths as well as Unix ones (POSIX), it
doesn't much matter how you do it.</li>

<li>Very clear instructions for creating the Unix directories can be
found at <a
href="http://www.woodsoup.org/projs/ORKiD/basic.htm">http://www.woodsoup.org/projs/ORKiD/basic.htm</a>.
Although the instructions are specifically for a slightly earlier
version of the program, they still obtain: the typical Unix
directories must still be created.

<li>As well, the cygwin.bat file needs to be modified. Cygnus suggests
that other files, too, need modification; but of these, the .bat file,
which specifies the commands and their sequence that bash must go
through, needs immediate modification.

<li>Configure your cygwin.bat file using Windows' Notepad utility or
other text editor (not Microsoft Word or anything that imparts
formatting) so that it looks something like this:</li>

</ul>

  <ul><p><span class="TypewriterPlain">@ECHO OFF<br>

  SET MAKE_MODE=Unix<br>

  SET CYGWIN=notty<br>

  SET HOME=C:\unix\HOME\[your home directory name]<br>

  SET TERM=VT100<br>


  CHDIR C:\Unix\HOME\[your home directory name]<br>

  SET PATH=C:\Unix\BIN;C:\Unix\USR\LOCAL\BIN;C:\CYGWIN\BIN;%PATH%<br>

  BASH</span><br>

  </ul>
<ul>

<p><li>Where the "unix" directory on the "C" drive contains the
traditional Unix directories. You can name it anything you want, as
long a you do not use anything that confuses Unix, e.g., hyphens,
spaces, etc.

<li>You should now have the C:\Cygwin directories, and your own
C:\unix directories, which include your crucial home directory.

<li>There is still one more, optional, step. For Cygwin to run
efficiently, you might want to configure the shortcut icon on your
desktop so that it starts the program in the right directory. This is
not necessary, if you have stipulated the HOME directory in the .bat
file.</li>

<li>Cygwin offers some further refinements, and, to be sure, there
will doubtless be some tweaking you will have to do to make have the
program running efficiently. Again, if you are familiar with Unix
commands and file structures, you will find this easy; if you are not,
Cygwin is quite forgiving, and you can get started with a minimum of
fuss. </li>

</ul>

<a name="HowtoConnect"></a><span class="InputHeader">Tunneling Using Cygwin: The Desktop Unix Emulator</span>
<ul>

<li>First, begin the program.</li>

<li>At the prompt, enter "<span class="TypewriterPlain">ssh -x -L 2401:localhost:2401 tunnel@DOMAINNAME</span>"</li>

  <li>Where DOMAINNAME is the name of this site.  The server should
  ask you for your password. Enter it. It is "<span
  class="TypewriterPlain">tunnel</span>"</li>

  <li>If this is your first time, the server will send you a message along these lines:

  <ul>

  <li><span class="TypewriterPlain">Host key not found from the list of known hosts.</span> </li>

  <li><span class="TypewriterPlain">Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?</span> </li>

  </ul>

  </li>

  <li>Enter "<span class="TypewriterPlain">Yes</span>." You can't just
  enter "y"; you have to spell it out. <li>The server will then
  respond with: "<span class="TypewriterPlain">Host "DOMAINNAME" added
  to the list of known hosts.</span>"

  <li>The screen does not show a prompt. That's how it should be. The
  tunnel has been established. You are now ready to begin using
  CVS. <li>You can, at this point, minimize the terminal, but do not
  close it or enter <span class="TypewriterPlain">Ctrl-C
  (^C)</span>. Doing so will kill the terminal tunnel.</li>

</ul>


<a name="terminating"></a><p><span class="InputHeader">Terminating the Tunnel</span>

<p>The easiest way to terminate the tunnel is to <span
class="TypewriterPlain">Ctrl-C (^C)</span> it out of existence. In
both the Mac OS and Windows environment, you can also close the client
window, thereby shutting the tunnel down.</p>


<p><span class="InputHeader">CVS</P></span>

<p><b>Accessing the CVS Repository</b></p>

<p>Once the SSH tunnel has been successfully established, you can
access the CVS repository, either by using, if on Windows, WinCVS, or
on Mac OS, Mac CVS, or by entering, at the prompt,

<ul>

<li><span class="TypewriterPlain">cvs -d :pserver:[USERNAME]@localhost:/CVS login</span></li>

<li><span class="TypewriterPlain">cvs -d :pserver:[USERNAME]@localhost:/CVS co [PROJECT]</span></li>

</ul>


<p>Where <span class="TypewriterPlain">[USERNAME]</span> is your
user name on the server and <span
class="TypewriterPlain">[PROJECT]</span> is the project directory.
