<hr NOSHADE SIZE=1><a NAME="cvsintro"></a><span CLASS="InputHeader">Getting
started with CVS</span>
<p>If you are participating in a development project on this site, you
must use CVS as the versioning control tool for project source files. This
is the first in a series of three tool documents covering information and
commands pertinent to using CVS.
<p>
<hr NOSHADE SIZE=1><a NAME="accesscvs"></a><span CLASS="InputHeader">Accessing
a project's CVS repository</span>
<p>If you do have cvs login access for a project hosted on this site, first
you must set the cvsroot to access the project's source code repository.
In your shell or terminal client, type:
<blockquote><b>:pserver:yourlogin@cvs.projectname.domain.com:/home/main_cvs_dir</b></blockquote>
substituting your login and project information.
<p>If you are only working on one project at a time, you only have to set
cvsroot the first time you log in to CVS.
<p>If you are participating in more than one project and need to access
CVS repositories located on different servers, you need to set the cvsroot
for each login session to access the correct project's source repository.
<p>If you do not have a specific cvs login but wish to look at an open
source project's source repository, you may still be able to log in to
cvs as "anonymous" by typing:
<blockquote><b>:pserver:anoncvs@cvs.projectname.domain.com:/home/main_cvs_dir</b></blockquote>
<a href="http://cvsbook.red-bean.com/cvsbook.html#Accessing_A_Repository" TARGET="_NEW">More
about accessing a CVS repository</a>
<p>To log in to CVS, use the following command:
<blockquote><b>cvs login</b></blockquote>
Enter your user password when prompted. This should be the same password
associated with your user account on this site.
<p>
<hr NOSHADE SIZE=1><span CLASS="InputHeader"><a NAME="gettingsource"></a>Getting
source files</span>
<p>To get a "working copy" of the latest source files, you must check out
the source files, a process which copies the files onto your system. First
create a directory on your local machine by typing:
<blockquote><b>mkdir my_working_dir</b> (the directory name of your choosing)
<br><b>cd my_working_dir</b></blockquote>
Then, to check out or copy source file from the repository into your newly
created local directory, type:
<blockquote><b>cvs checkout project_name</b></blockquote>
This top-level module would contain the entire source code tree (that is,
the top level directory and any subdirectories) for that part of the project.
There is a fairly common module structure for project CVS repositories
initially. As the project grows, the project's source "tree" also grows
as subdirectories are added to various modules.
<p>To obtain the source code for a particular module called "module-name"
within the project named "project_name", specify:
<blockquote><b>cvs checkout module_name/project_name</b></blockquote>
<a href="http://cvsbook.red-bean.com/cvsbook.html#Checking_Out_A_Working_Copy" TARGET="_NEW">More
about checking out a working copy of project files</a>
<p>
<hr NOSHADE SIZE=1><a NAME="cvslog"></a><span CLASS="InputHeader">Viewing
file revision history</span>
<p>Anyone with cvs read permission can view individual file histories to
track revision information by typing:
<blockquote><b>cvs log filename</b></blockquote>
The result is a display of the file's revision information, starting with
the most current revision, and includes such information as the log message,
status, working revision number, and repository revision number.

about file revision numbers</a>
<p><a NAME="cvsdiff"></a><span CLASS="HelpTextHeader">Comparing file revisions</span>
<p>To see the particulars of a file's modifications between two revisions,
after obtaining file revision numbering information from the "<b>cvs log</b>"
command's output, type:
<blockquote><b>cvs diff -r revision_# -r revision_#</b></blockquote>
The entire file contents display with lines from both versions where differences
occur marked by revision number.&nbsp;
