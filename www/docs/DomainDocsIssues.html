     <P>Issues are tasks and activities associated with development
     projects. These are tracked with IssueZilla, a variant of the
     BugZilla bug tracking system with several important
     differences. The most important distinction is that IssueZilla is
     more generalized to handle all kinds of <I>issues</I> -- not just
     code-based <I>bugs</I> -- in collaborative development
     projects. Issues are classified into several types:

      <UL>
       <LI>defects (a.k.a. "bugs")
       <LI>enhancements
       <LI>features
       <LI>tasks
       <LI>patches
      </UL>
<P>
(<A HREF="/project/gridengine/docs/DomainDocsIssues_EnterModify.html#issue_type">See issue definitions for more
information.</A>)

     <P>Another important difference is that you do not have to log in
     separately to IssueZilla. Each hosted project has its own unique
     issue database that project members have access to.

     <P>IssueZilla enables <I>any project member</I> to query, create,
     assign, and modify issues for specific project components. As a
     project member, you are also notified automatically by email
     whenever issues are assigned to you and whenever there is
     activity on issues affecting your work. Entering the tasks you're
     planning to work on as issues helps you track your work
     plan. Because everyone is clued in to each project member's area
     of work, you can avoid duplicating efforts and even help out or
     offer feedback to each other.

     <P>Using issue tracking effectively requires an understanding of
     the IssueZilla tool and a working knowledge of what constitutes a
     well-written issue report.

     <P><FONT SIZE="-1"><B><I>**</I></B> The BugZilla help
     documentation listed above offers useful bug-writing guidelines
     that are applicable to IssueZilla, however be aware that there
     are differences between the two tools. Parts of BugZilla
     documentation may not apply or may not address certain features
     in IssueZilla, and vice versa. Because IssueZilla is an open
     source derivative of BugZilla (version 2.11), it is still a work
     in progress. For those who are interested in more information
     about this, visit <a

     are a prerequisite for creating an account and logging in to
     IssueZilla. If cookies are disabled on your system, you will at
     least need to enable the following cookies: "Issuezilla_login" or

     cookies to cache an issue's current version and for ordering the
