<hr noshade size=1><a NAME="whatfor"></a><span class="InputHeader">What
are project files?</span>
<p>The <b>Project Files</b> page, maintained by the Project Owner or whomever
he/she has delegated, lists all those project-related files that can be
easily downloaded and which do not require a concurrent versioning system
(CVS) for tracking simultaneous effort. If you wish to download source
code, which does require CVS, please first read the <a href="ProjectSource.html">Project
Source help</a> page. Depending on the project owner's preferences, the
files on the <b>Project Download</b> page can include binaries, "tarballs,"
"zip" files, graphics, and more. Generally, the files available here represent
the results of the project's completed or milestone efforts. Working files
and documents for this project can be found on the <b>Project Documentation</b>
page.
<p>The <b>Project Files</b> page is laid out so that you can easily see
the title of the file, a brief description of it, and its MD5 Checksum.
This latter feature, the MD5 Checksum, is a number that uniquely identifies
each file. If you have a Linux machine, or have access to a Unix-type system
at your download location, you can generate an MD5 number and check it
against the number on the site. The two should be identical; if they are
not, it indicates that the file has been corrupted in transit, and should
not be used.
<br>
<hr noshade size=1><a NAME="downloadingfiles"></a><span class="InputHeader">Downloading
and verifying files</span>
<p>To download a file, click on the underlined title of the file. The download
should then commence immediately. If you have the capability, once the
file has been downloaded, you can check it's MD5 number against that posted
on the site.
<p>If, for some reason, the download did not work (and you've tried at
least once again), be sure to contact the Project Owner, informing him/her
of the problematic file, the nature of your difficulty, and of the particulars
of your computer set up.&nbsp;
