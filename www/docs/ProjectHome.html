<p>The <b>Project Home</b> page for any particular project is the project's
focal point with information that the project owner wishes to share with
members and non-members alike. Because project home pages can be customized,
these vary greatly, depending on the project owner's preferences. At a
minimum, the owner should include content describing the nature and goals
of the project. Interested users can also use the project's hyperlinks
in the Project Resources tool bar above to learn more about the project,
including subscribing to that project's mailing lists.
<p>If you have become a project member, you'll find that your project's
home page looks pretty much the same as it does to other users, with the
exception of additional links in the upper right-hand corner you can use
to request a new project role.
<p>You can learn more about project information and activities available
to you now using the links below as you continue through the "Project resources
for members" index.
