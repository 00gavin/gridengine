     <p>When you join a hosted development project on this site, you
     automatically get an IssueZilla account for access to project
     issues.

     <p>Information about your account is available under "Edit prefs"
     in the IssueZilla toolbar. You have several options to change how
     your account is configured.
     <p>

       <DD>Include/exclude "My issues" or your named, custom queries in every IssueZilla page footer.
    </DL>
     <p>
     You can also view a list of IssueZilla permissions assigned to you.
     <p>
     <A NAME="permissions"><span class="InputHeader">About permissions</span></A>

     <p>Once you become a member of a project, you gain additional
     IssueZilla permissions beyond querying the issue database. You
     can view your permissions using the "Edit prefs" link in the
     IssueZilla tool bar. Your permissions depend upon your role in a
     project:

<UL>

<LI>If you are an observer, you can report new issues and modify
issues, <I>but you can only make changes to your own issues</I>. You
can, however, comment on any issue.

<P>

<LI>If you are a developer (code or content), you can report and
modify your own <I>and other project members'</I> issues. If you have
the "Can edit all aspects of any issue" permission, then you can tweak
anything about any issue, including milestones and issue assignments.

<P>

<LI>If you are a project owner, you are an administrative level
IssueZilla user who can assign permissions to other project
members. (See more about <A NAME="adminpermissions">administrative
permissions</A> below.)

</UL>

Whatever your role in a project, if you really feel that you ought to
have additional IssueZilla permissions, the project owner is the right
person to ask (via private email, please!). You may need to request a
new role.

<p>
Permissions are important because they are linked to the lifecycle and
resolution of issues. For example, if you have the "Can confirm an
issue" permission, then you can change the status of any
<B>UNCONFIRMED</B> issue to <B>NEW</B>. This is critical because it
serves as a green light to the person the issue is assigned to (and
anyone else connected with the issue) by confirming that the issue is
"real." To understand more about issue status, read more about the <A
HREF="/project/gridengine/docs/issue_lifecycle.html">lifecycle of an issue</A>.

     <p>
     <A NAME="adminpermissions"><span class="InputHeader">Admin Setup</span></A>
     <P>

     <p>If you are a project owner, you automatically have
     administrative permissions in IssueZilla to manage and track your
     project's issues. Admin options appearing in the IssueZilla tool
     bar allow you to:
     <p>
     <UL>
      <LI>modify IssueZilla's overall configuration for your project, including adding custom pages
      <LI>conduct "sanity checks" to identify any anomalies in your project's issues database
      <LI>enter and modify project components
      <LI>edit user information and privileges
      <LI>define groups and assign users to groups
     </UL>
     <p>Probably the most significant permission you have as a project
     owner is the ability to edit the permissions of all other users
     on your project. This can include giving other users
     administrative permissions to delegate some of your issue
     management workload.
     <p>
     If a project member has submitted several issues that get
     confirmed, then this is probably a person who understands the
     project and the issue tracking system well, and deserves the "Can
     confirm an issue" permission. As a project owner, you should
     track this and proactively manage user permissions assignments
     accordingly.
