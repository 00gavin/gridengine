<td>To set up master shadowing in Grid Engine, the following steps must
be taken.&nbsp;
<ol>
<div STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">1) Create the shadow_masters file&nbsp;</div>
<div STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">2) Verify correct permissions&nbsp;</div>
<div STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">3) Start the shadowd daemon(s)
</ol><p>
<b>1) Create a shadow_masters file</b>
<p>The file needs to be created in $SGE_ROOT/default/common. This file
should contain the name of the primary master host as the first line. Other
hosts that are chosen to assume master responsibility should then be listed
in the order desired. For example:
<p>>cat shadow_masters
<br>host1
<br>host2
<br>host3
<p>Here, host1 is the primary master host. Should host1 fail, host2 will
take over as the master server after a period of approximately 10 minutes.
Further, if host2 should then fail, host3 will take over.
<p><b>2) Verify correct permissions</b>
<p>All master shadow hosts must have read/write permissions to the qmaster
spool directory.
<p><b>3) Start the shadow daemons</b>
<p>The shadow daemon must be started on all shadow master hosts. This is
done via the startup script, rcsge. As root on each host, run the following:&nbsp;
<pre STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">
&nbsp;$SGE_ROOT/default/common/rcsge -shadowd  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Version 5.3 and its patches]
&nbsp;$SGE_ROOT/default/common/sgemaster -shadowd   [Version 6 or later]
</pre>
After these steps are successfully completed, master shadowing for the Grid Engine cluster
is active. See under <a href="http://gridengine.sunsource.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=497">issue #497</a>
for more information about shadowd failover delay and check interval.</td>

When using this shadow master feature with the master hosts with
<a href="http://gridengine.sunsource.net/project/gridengine/howto/multi_intrfcs.html">multiple 
network interfaces</a>, the following things have to be addressed.</p>

<ul><li>Version 6 release must install the Update 1 patch to make the shadow master 
work.</li> 
<li>Version 5.3 and its patch releases need to create a symbolic link to each 
of shadow masters as shown below at $SGE_ROOT/default/spool/qmaster directory.
This is because the shadow daemon still looks for the following file name associated with 
the old hostname while the rcsge script looks for the file name associated with the 
new hostname assigned to the Grid Engine traffic. An example is given below.
<pre>
   % ls -l $SGE_ROOT/default/spool/qmaster 
   ...
   lrwxrwxrwx 1 sge sge 17 Sep 28 09:01 shadowd_host1-ge.pid -> shadowd_host1.pid
   -rw-r--r-- 1 sge sge 17 Sep 28 09:00 shadowd_host1.pid
   lrwxrwxrwx 1 sge sge 17 Sep 28 09:02 shadowd_host2-ge.pid -> shadowd_host2.pid
   -rw-r--r-- 1 sge sge 17 Sep 28 09:00 shadowd_host2.pid
</pre>
In this example, host1 and host2 are hostnames for two shadow masters. Also 
host1-ge and host2-ge are the names for Grid Engine network interfaces.
<pre>
   % cat /etc/hosts
   #
   # hostnames
   #
   192.168.8.10   host1
   192.168.8.11   host2
   #
   # Grid Engine Network 
   #
   192.168.9.10   host1-ge
   192.168.9.11   host2-ge
</pre>

<li>Version 5.3 and its patch releases need to keep both new and old hostnames 
in the shadow_masters file due to the 
reason mentioned above. An example is given below.
<pre>
   % cat shadow_masters
   host1
   host2
   host1-ge
   host2-ge
</pre>
</li></ul>
