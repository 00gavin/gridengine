<td>To set up master shadowing in Grid Engine, the following steps must
be taken.&nbsp;
<ol>
<div STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">1) Create the shadow_masters file&nbsp;</div>

<div STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">2) Verify correct permissions&nbsp;</div>

<p>0) Start the shadowd daemon(s)</ol>
<b>1) Create a shadow_masters file</b>
<p>The file needs to be created in $SGE_ROOT/default/common. This file
should contain the name of the primary master host as the first line. Other
hosts that are chosen to assume master responsibility should then be listed
in the order desired. For example:
<p>>cat shadow_masters
<br>host1
<br>host2
<br>host3
<p>Here, host1 is the primary master host. Should host1 fail, host2 will
take over as the master server after a period of approximately 10 minutes.
Further, if host2 should then fail, host3 will take over.
<p><b>2) Verify correct permissions</b>
<p>All master shadow hosts must have read/write permissions to the qmaster
spool directory.
<p><b>3) Start the shadow daemons</b>
<p>The shadow daemon must be started on all shadow master hosts. This is
done via the startup script, sge5. As root on each host, run the following:&nbsp;
<pre STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&nbsp;$SGE_ROOT/default/common/sge5 -shadowd</pre>
After these steps are completed, master shadowing for the Grid Engine cluster
is active.</td>
