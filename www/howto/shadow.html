<H2>Setting Up A Shadow Master In Grid Engine</H2>

<P>To set up master shadowing in Grid Engine, the following steps
must be taken.

</OL>
<P>1) Create a shadow_masters file<BR><BR>The file needs to be
created in $SGE_ROOT/default/common. This file should contain the
name of the primary master host as the first line. Other hosts that
are chosen to assume master responsibility should then be listed in
the order desired. For example:<BR><BR>&gt;cat shadow_masters
<BR>host1<BR>host2<BR>host3<BR><BR>Here, host1 is the primary master
host. Should host1 fail, host2 will take over as the master server
after a period of approximately 10 minutes. Further, if host2 should
then fail, host3 will take over.</P>
<P>2) Verify correct permissions.<BR><BR>All master shadow hosts must
have read/write permissions to the qmaster spool directory.</P>
<P>3) Start the shadowd daemons.<BR><BR>The shadow daemon must be
started on all shadow master hosts. This is done via the startup
script, sge5. As root on each host, run the following:

After these steps are completed, master shadowing for the Grid Engine
cluster is active.</P>
