<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Overview</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Sun Grid Engine provides general support for checkpointing, which
can be categorized into three types:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>Application level (checkpointing is hard coded in the
	application)</P>
	<LI><P>User level (using checkpointing libraries)</P>
	<LI><P>Kernel level (OS provided checkpointing)</P>
</OL>
<P>This application note will relate to item 2 above. The User level
checkpointing library selected here is the Condor standalone library
from the University of Wisconsin's Condor system project at
<A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor">http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor</A>.
The web site contains further information about Condor.

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>NOTE:</B>The reader is warned here
about the set of restrictions that come with user level checkpointing
libraries. The following web page outlines the current Condor
checkpointing libraries restrictions:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/manual/v6.2/1_4Current_Limitations.html">http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/manual/v6.2/1_4Current_Limitations.html</A></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Condor
Checkpointing library</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Condor is a full job management system that includes a user level
checkpointing library. The static Condor checkpointing library, when
linked, provides a layer around the application to be checkpointed.
The library will basically intercept the checkpointing signal and
attempt to save the state of the application together with system
information in a checkpointing file whose location is determined by
the user during configuration time. The Condor checkpointing library
can be used either as an integral part of the Condor system or as
stand-alone with a separate resource management system such as the
Sun Grid Engine product. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Standalone
checkpointing library setup</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>This document (or How To) will only cover the standalone scenario
that will be used with the checkpointing facility of the Sun Grid
Engine software. In this case, there is no need to install the whole
Condor software because we only care about the following:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 2cm">a) the entire Condor &quot;lib&quot;
subdirectory</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 2cm">b) the condor_compile command (from the
bin subdirectory)</P>
<P>The condor_compile shell script file needs to be modified at the
following line:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">CONDOR_LIBDIR=`condor_config_val LIB`</PRE><P>
to:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">CONDOR_LIBDIR=&quot;install_path_of_condor_lib&quot; </PRE><P>
where &quot;install_path_of_condor_lib&quot; is the path to the
entire contents of the Condor &quot;lib&quot; subdirectory. The above
setup allows sequential applications to be checkpointed using the
user level checkpointing Condor libraries. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Checkpointed
Application Preparation</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>A regular application that needs to be checkpointed does not
require any source level modifications. It only needs to be re-linked
with the Condor checkpointing libraries to take advantage of the
Checkpointing and Remote System Calls. An easy mechanism which is
provided by Condor helps to perform the relink operation by using the
condor_compile command as follows:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">condor_compile -condor_standalone <I>command</I> [options/files....] </PRE><P>
where <CODE><I>command</I></CODE> is any of cc, f77, f90, ld, etc and
[options/files....] are the normal arguments used by the
compiler/linker.

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Configuring
SGE's checkpointing environment</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<OL TYPE=a>
	<LI><P>Configure host queue to support checkpointing</P>
	<LI><P>The application can be set up to checkpoint when the
	sge_execd daemon is shutdown and when the job is suspended.</P>
	<LI><P>Configure the job to be rescheduled in case it is suspended.</P>
	<LI><P>The checkpoint signal should be set up to SIGTSTP because
	Condor uses it to checkpoint the application and exit. There is
	however the SIGUSR2 signal used by Condor to checkpoint the
	application and let it continue its normal execution.</P>
	<LI><P>Finally, 'userdefined' checkpointing was set. Userdefined
	checkpointing means that the application periodically writes
	checkpoints without any interference by SGE. At restart time the
	application will continue at the last checkpoint.

a user level checkpointing job</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>The submission of a checkpointing job in a SGE environment is
similar to the submission of a regular job with the addition of the
following options to the qsub command:</P>

	<LI><P>I assume that Condor libraries and condor_compile command are
	installed on the system.</P>
	<LI><P>The steps described below all have equivalent functions from
	the qmon(1) GUI. For the sake of simplicity the example is
	illustrated using the command line.</P>
	<LI><P>I used a cluster of 2 nodes named hpc0 and hpc1.</P>

<P><I>3a. Execute the following command: </I>
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">qsub -cwd -v TERM -ckpt condor_ckpt -c x example.script </PRE><P>
I used the option &quot;-c x&quot; because I wanted the job to be
checkpointed only when it is suspended. In this example, the job gets
suspended through suspension of the queue on which the job is running
(see step 4 &amp; 5). The -c option provides other options and the
reader is urged to consult the qsub(1) manual page. 
</P>
<P><B>Step 4: Suspend hpc0.q queue on which the checkpointing job is
running. </B>
</P>
<P><I>4a. Execute the following command to suspend hpc0.q: </I>
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">qmod -s hpc0.q </PRE><P>
The job will migrate to the other queue hpc1.q. 
</P>
<P>Use &quot;qstat -f&quot; to check the new status of jobs/queues. 
</P>
<P><I>4b. Execute the following command to unsuspend hpc0.q: </I>
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">qmod -us hpc0.q </PRE><P>

<P><I>5a. Execute the following command to suspend hpc1.q: </I>
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">qmod -s hpc1.q </PRE><P>
The job will migrate to the other queue : hpc0.q.
