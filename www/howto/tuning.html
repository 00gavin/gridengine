<H1>Tuning guide</H1>
<P>Grid Engine is a common purpose tool. The scheduler supports a
wide range of different compute farm scenarios. To get the maximum
from your compute environment it can be worth to review which
features are in effect and which are really needed to solve your load
management problem. Disabling some of these features can have a
noticeably positive effect on the throughput of your cluster:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>scheduler monitoring</P>
	<P>Scheduler monitoring can be helpful to find out the reason why
	certain jobs are not dispatched. However providing this information
	for all jobs at any time can be resource consuming and is usually
	not needed. To disable scheduler monitoring set 'schedd_job_info' to
	'false' in scheduler configuration

   .</P>
	<LI><P>finished jobs</P>
	<P>In case of array jobs the finished job list in qmaster can become
	quite big. Switching it off will save memory and speed up qstat
	commands, because qstat also fetches the finished jobs list. Set
	'finished_jobs' to '0' in global confiugration

   .</P>
	<LI><P>job verification</P>
	<P>Forcing a validation at jobs submission time can be valuable tool
	to prevent non dispatchable jobs in pending state. Especially in
	heterogenous environments with a varity of different execution nodes
	and consumable resources and every user having it's own job profile
	it can be a time consuming job to handle non dispatchable jobs. In
	homogenous environments with only a couple of different jobs a
	general expensive job validation usually can be omitted. Job
	verification is disabled by adding the

   option &quot;-w n&quot;
	in the cluster wide default requests (see 
<A HREF="http://gridengine.sunsource.net/unbranded-source/browse/~checkout~/gridengine/doc/htmlman/htmlman5/sge_request.html?content-type=text/html" NAME="qsub">sge_request(5)</A>
   ).</P>
	<LI><P>load thresholds and suspend thresholds</P>
	<P>The load thresholds are needed if you consciously oversubscribe
	your machines and you need mechanism to limit oversubscription and
	also suspend thresholds are used in connection with
	oversubscription. The other case in which load thresholds are needed
	is when the execution node is still open for interactive load which
	is not under control of Grid Engine and you wan't to prevent the
	node from being overloaded. If a compute farm is that easy, that
	each CPU at a compute node is represended by only one queue slot and
	no interactive load is expected at these nodes then
	'load_thresholds' can be omitted. To disable both thresholds set
	'load_thresholds' to 'none' and 'suspend_thresholds' to 'none' (see
<A HREF="http://gridengine.sunsource.net/unbranded-source/browse/~checkout~/gridengine/doc/htmlman/htmlman5/queue_conf.html?content-type=text/html" NAME="queue_conf">queue_conf(5)</A>
   ).</P>
	<LI><P>load adjustments</P>
	<P>The load adjustments are used to virually increase the measured
	load after a job has been dispachted. This mechanism is helpful in
	case of oversubscribed machines to align with load thresholds. Load
	adjustments should be switched off if they are not needed because
	they impose the scheduler some additional work in connection sorting
	hosts and load thresholds verification. To disable load adjustments
	set 'job_load_adjustments' to 'none' and
	'load_adjustment_decay_time' to '0' in the scheduler configuration
