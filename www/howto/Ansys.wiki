=== Distributed Ansys ===

Issues with running distributed Ansys was topic in [http://gridengine.sunsource.net/servlets/ReadMsg?list=users&msgNo=18906 How to configure SGE to run Distributed Ansys jobs]. 

Starting point was the question how to run distributed ansys100 such as

 ansys100 -pp -dis -b -machines machine1:2:machine2:2machine3:2 < input file > output file.

as Grid Engine batch job. 

The information required for -machines will have to come from $PE_HOSTFILE (see [http://gridengine.sunsource.net/nonav/source/browse/~checkout~/gridengine/doc/htmlman/htmlman1/qsub.html  qsub(1)]). This environemnt variable points to the Grid Engine PE host file described in [http://gridengine.sunsource.net/nonav/source/browse/~checkout~/gridengine/doc/htmlman/manuals.html?content-type=text/html sge_pe(1)] when a job was submitted as [[parallel job]]. It is thus necessary to find a solution that transforms [[PE host file]] information into the syntax format required by the ansys100 -machines option. The solution for this is very similar to what is done in $SGE_ROOT/mpi/startmpi.sh file in Grid Engine [[common package]].
