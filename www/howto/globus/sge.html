<h2>GRAM Job Manager and Reporter Support for SGE (Sun Grid Engine)</h2>

<table aligh="CENTER" border="0" width="80%">
<tbody><tr><td><ul>
  <li><p>Globus team has provided GRAM Job Manager and Reporter Scheduler
    Support for many popular schedulers (see
    <a href="http://www.globus.org/gt2.4/download.html">download page</a>).
    Unfortunately, the support for Sun Grid Engine is lacking.
  </p></li><li><p>Some time ago, I've made a <a href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/%7Emarko/ETF/grd.html">perl module for GRD</a>
    (<strong>now obsolete</strong>), which was used at London eScience Centre
    (LeSC).
  </p></li><li><p>Since then, the module has been improved, all known bugs fixed
    and packaged. Furthermore, a package for GRAM SGE Reporter is also
    available. You are welcome to download and use the packages.
  </p></li><li><p>I would like to thank Paulo Tiberio Bulhoes who was involved at one
    stage of the project for his suggestions.
  </p></li><li><p>The packages has been tested on all LeSC's Globus (v2.2.3 and
    v2.2.4) and SGE/SGEEE (v5.3) enabled resources. Of course, your feedback
    (positive or negative) is welcome (marko at imperial.ac.uk).
  </p></li><li><p>Please note that I take no responsibility for any loss and/or
    damage this might cause.

</p><h3>Features</h3>
<table aligh="CENTER" border="0" width="80%">
<tbody><tr><td><ul>
  <li>The job manager is installed as <tt>jobmanager-sge</tt> by default.
    This option can be easily changed.
  </li><li>If available, Sun MPI is used by default. One can disable Sun MPI and
    use another implementation.
  </li><li>We have the following mapping:
    <p>
    </p><ul>
    <li>If job type is single and count is one, run a single copy of a job
    </li><li>If job type is single and count is at least 2, submit a job array
        with corresponding count.
    </li><li>If job type is multiple, submit count copies of a job
    </li><li>If job is mpi, run mpirun
    </li></ul>
    <p>
  </p></li><li>System admin can specify a default MPI Parallel Envirnonment (PE),
    which will be used for MPI/multiple jobs. Of course, only PEs integrated
    into SGE/SGEEE on your system are supported. By default, no PE is
    specified. Note that this value will be over-written by SGE_PE/GRD_PE
    value in a RSL file.
  </li><li>One can enable PE and queue validation. That is, available PEs and
    queues are found and added in a RVF validation file
    (<tt>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/globus_gram_job_manager/sge.rvf</tt>). PE and
    queue validation is disabled by default.
  </li><li>Monitoring your job by email is also supported, that is, one can
    specify <tt>email_address, emailonexecution, emailontermination,
    emailonabort</tt> and <tt>emailonsuspend</tt> as additional RSL
    attributes.
  </li><li>After installing the SGE job manager, your RVF
    (<tt>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/globus_gram_job_manager/sge.rvf</tt>) will
    look something like <a href="http://gridengine.sunsource.net/project/gridengine/howto/globus/sge.rvf">this</a>.
  </li><li>A sample RSL file is also provided: <a href="http://gridengine.sunsource.net/project/gridengine/howto/globus/sge.rsl">sge.rsl</a>.
