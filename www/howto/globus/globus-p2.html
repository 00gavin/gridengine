    <h1>Adding Sun HPC ClusterTools Support</h1>

Once the basic integration between Sun Grid Engine and Globus is successfully completed, both Sun Grid Engine and Globus can be further customized to support MPI parallel jobs using Sun HPC ClusterTools software.

<p>
The first step for the customization is to create connection between Sun Grid Engine and Sun HPC ClusterTools software. This integration can be
accomplished by an easy integration script with accompanied scripts for job controls. The integration package is contained in the 
"Grid Engine common files" package since 5.3 beta2 in the $SGE_ROOT/mpi/sunhpc/loose-integration/ subdirectory. Please click <a href="http://gridengine.sunsource.net/project/gridengine/download.html">here</a> to download the package.
<p> 
The second step is to modify Globus environment to support Sun MPI job submission through the Globus command. This involves a couple of step as shown below (Globus version 1.x).
<ul>
<li>
<b><a href="./add-sunmpi-service.html">Add "jobmanager-sge" service</a></b></li>

<li>
<b><a href="./copy-sge-scripts.html">Copy GRAM SGE scripts into the deploy directory</a></b></li>


<br><font color="#FF6666">Note: The GRAM scripts are customized based on
the fact that the default install configuration of SGE and the default 
integration between SGE and Sun HPC ClusterTools are used.</font>
</ul>

<p>The following shows an example to submit an Sun MPI job to Sun Grid Engine 
through Globus. As discussed above, the submission is based on the default 
integration between Sun Grid Engine and Sun HPC ClusterTools. 
The job requests two MPI processes.

<pre>
With the new GRAM scripts for SGE:

globusrun -r "hpc-node1.sun.com:2119/jobmanager-sge:" \
'&(jobtype=mpi) \
(directory=/home/byun/projects/JMS/Globus/ex03) \
(executable=/home/byun/projects/JMS/Globus/ex03/monte) \
(stdout=/home/byun/projects/JMS/Globus/ex03/ex03-output) \
(stderr=/home/byun/projects/JMS/Globus/ex03/ex03-error) \
(environment=(SGE_PE hpc) (SGE_CRE cre)) \
(count=2)'

</pre>
