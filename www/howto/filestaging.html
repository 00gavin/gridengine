         How does file staging work?
      </FONT>
   </H1>

   <P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">
      When the submit host and the execution host do not have access to a
      common, shared file system or are simply using different root directories,
      the necessary job data must be copied (via rcp or a similar utility) to
      the execution host, and the job results must be copied back to the submit
      host.
   </P>

   <P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">
      Because such a file staging mechanism must be very flexible and fully
      configurable, it is desirable to let the actual copying be handled by the
      system itself, such as by a script written by the administrator, so that
      one can focus on just the necessary data.  Because the actual work of
      copying is delegated to the system, i.e. the script, the term
      &quot;delegated file staging&quot; is used.  With delegated file staging
      in the Grid Engine 6.0 release two scripts are needed.  The first is
      called in the prolog and copies the input data to the selected execution
      host.  The second is called in the epilog and copies the results to the
      submit host.

         What do the delegated file staging scripts do?
      </FONT>
   </H1>

   <P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">
      The scripts must, at a minimum, copy the stdin, stdout, and stderr files
      either from the submit host to the execution host or vice versa.
   </P>

   <P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">
      The additional needed information is obtained by the script from
      command-line parameters, which can be set in the cluster configuration
      using the &quot;qconf -mconf&quot; command.  Under &quot;prolog&quot;,
      after the path to the prolog script(s), the following variables can be
      given to be replaced automatically by the DRM with the appropriate,
      corresponding values when the prolog is called:

      Now delegated file staging is available for use.

   <H1>
      <FONT COLOR="#336699">
         And how does one use the thing?
      </FONT>
   </H1>

   <P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">
      From this point forward, we are talking specifically about using delegated
      file staging with DRMAA.  For more information on DRMAA, see the
      <A HREF="drmaa.html">DRMAA howto</A>.
   </P>

   <P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">
      Because drmaa_transfer_files is an optional attribute in DRMAA, the first
      thing an application must do is use drmaa_get_attribute_names() to
      determine if the attribute is supported by the DRMAA implementation in
      use.  The DRMAA implementation provided with Grid Engine 6.0 only supports
      the drmaa_transfer_files attribute when <CODE>delegated_file_staging
      true</CODE> is enabled in the cluster configuration.  (See the previous
      section.)
   </P>

   <P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">
      If the drmaa_transfer_files attribute is available, the application can
      set this attribute's value to one of following: &quot;i&quot;,
      &quot;o&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, or a concatinated combination of the three,
      such as &quot;oi&quot;.  Each letter, if present in the attribute's value
      indicated that the corresponding data source should be copied using
      delegated file tranferal.
