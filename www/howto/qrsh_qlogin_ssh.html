			<P>By default, the Grid Engine commands <B>qrsh</B> will use

			<P>To enable the rsh/rlogin mechanism, special rsh and rlogin
			binaries are provided with Grid Engine (found in

				<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">compression (if lots of data

			</UL>
			<H3 STYLE="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in">Disadvantages:</H3>
			<UL>
				<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">lack of complete accounting: the online usage of the jobs is not collected, only the wallclock time. 
				</P>
				<LI><P>lack of dynamic reprioritization: the feature of adjusting the job's priority according to the Ticket policies is not available (see <b>reprioritize</b> parameter in man <b>sge_conf(5)</b>).
				<LI><P>potential loss of control: in some unusual cases, killing the job might leave behind idle or busy processes, even if the job is seen as finished by Grid Engine.
