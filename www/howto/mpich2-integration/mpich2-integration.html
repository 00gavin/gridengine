<blockquote><b>Configuration of SGE with qconf or the GUI</b>
  <p>You should already know how to change settings in SGE, like to
setup and change a queue definition or the entries in the PE
configuration. Additional information about queues and parallel
interfaces you can get from the man pages "queue_conf" and "sge_pe" of
SGE (make sure the SGE man pages are defined in your $MANPATH).</p>
  <p><b>Target platform</b></p>
  <p>This Howto targets the MPICH2 version 1.0.8 and SGE 6.2 on Linux.
Most likely it will work under other operating systems in the same way.
Some of the commands will in this case need slight modifications. It
will not work this way for MPICH2 version 1.0, as some things were only
adjusted since 1.0.1, which will allow an easy Tight Integration.</p>
  <p><b>MPICH2</b></p>
  <p>The MPICH2 is a library from the Argonne National Laboratory (<a
 href="http://www.anl.gov">http://www.anl.gov</a>) which is an
implementation of the MPI-2 standard. Before you start with the
integration of MPICH2 into SGE, you should already be familiar with the
operation of MPICH2 outside of SGE and know how to compile a parallel
program using MPICH2.</p>
  <p><b>Included setups and scripts</b></p>
  <p>The supplied archive in [<a
 href="#%5B1%5D%20Archive%20sge-mpich2-integration">1</a>] contains the
necessary scripts for the mpd and smpd startup methods (for the gforker
method only the example shell script is included, as this startup
method needs no scripts to start and stop any daemon). It contains
scripts and programs
similar to the distribution of the PVM and MPICH integration package in
SGE. For installing it for common usage in the whole cluster, you may
like to untar it in $SGE_ROOT to get the new directories
$SGE_ROOT/mpich2_mpd, $SGE_ROOT/mpich2_smpd, $SGE_ROOT/mpich2_smpd_rsh
and $SGE_ROOT/mpich2_gforker.</p>
  <p>A short program is provided in [<a
 href="#%5B2%5D%20Archive%20mpi_hello">2</a>], which will allow you to
observe the correct distribution of the spawned tasks.</p>

<font size="+1"><b>Introduction to the MPICH2 family</b></font>
<blockquote>This new MPICH2 implementation of the MPI-2 standard was
created to supersede the widely used MPICH(1) implementation. Besides
implementing the MPI-2 standard, another goal was a faster startup. To
give the user a greater flexibility, there are (for now) 3 startup
methods implemented:
  <ul>
    <li><i>mpd</i>: As the primary startup method <i>mpd</i>
is introduced in MPICH2. It&#8217;s based on the script language Python to
startup a so called <i>ring</i> of machines. Giving <i>mpdboot</i>
a list of nodes it will startup daemons on the requested machines,
which
can be used immediately for the execution of parallel programs inside
this <i>ring</i>. This is convenient for the interactive
use of a parallel program, as the only thing which must be prepared is
a list of to be used nodes.<br>
      <br>
Due to limitations in <span style="font-style: italic;">mpdboot</span>,
it must have a connection to the daemons on the nodes via stdin/stdout,
until the <span style="font-style: italic;">mpd</span>
fork into daemonland. Therefore this Howto will instead launch the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">mpd</span> in a script
defined in start_proc_args one after the other, so that the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">mpd</span> are still bound the started <span
 style="font-style: italic;">sge_shepherd</span>.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li><i>smpd</i>: This startup method can be used in a daemon based
or daemonless mode. The daemon based startup is not creating all the
daemons on the nodes according to a nodelist on its own (like it is
done by the <span style="font-style: italic;">mpdboot</span> command
in the <span style="font-style: italic;">mpd</span> startup method),
but the daemons have to be started
before the execution of the main program, e.g. by a script. In this
Howto, a startup of the daemons will be presented where they are
started by the given procedure to start_proc_args.<br>
      <br>
A daemonless startup is very similar to the startup of the tasks in the
former MPICH(1). Although it includes the same scripts from the
original
$SGE_ROOT/mpi, it&#8217;s included here (with some editing to the templates),
so that it can easily be used with a still installed $SGE_ROOT/mpi
without any side effects.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li><i>gforker</i>: Programs started under <i>gforker</i> are
limited to one machine and supports only forks for additional processes.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Be aware, that for each startup method and chosen way to compile
them, you will get a set of <i>mpirun</i> and/or <i>mpiexec</i> for
each of them. They are not interchangeable! Hence, once you installed <i>mpd</i>
and compiled a program to run in the <i>ring</i>, you <b>can&#8217;t </b>switch
to <i>smpd</i> simply by using a different <i>mpirun</i> or <i>mpiexec</i>.
Instead you have to recompile (or at least relink) your program with
the intended libraries to be used with this specific startup method.
This means, that you have to plan carefully your set $PATH during
compilation and execution of the parallel program, to get a correct
behavior. Not doing so will result in strange error messages, which
will not point directly to the cause of trouble. After compiling your
application software, it may be advisable not to rely on the set $PATH
in your interactive shell for the submission, but to set it explicitly
in the submitted script to SGE, as we will do it in this Howto for
demonstration purpose. Also note, that the preferred startup command in
MPICH2 is <i>mpiexec</i>, not <i>mpirun</i>.</p>

<font size="+1"><b>Tight Integration of the mpd
startup
method</b></font>
<blockquote>First we discuss the integration of the preferred startup
method in MPICH2, called <span style="font-style: italic;">mpd</span>.
You can compile MPICH2 after you
configured it; maybe with&nbsp;an alternative path for the installation
of the parallel library:
  <blockquote>
    <pre>$ ./configure --prefix=/home/reuti/local/mpich2-1.0.8/mpd</pre>
  </blockquote>
  <p>After the usual <i>make</i> and <i>make
install</i> we can compile the short program which is supplied in
[<a href="mpich2-integration-work.html#%5B2%5D%20Archive%20mpi_hello">2</a>]
with:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>$ mpicc -o mpihello mpihello.c</pre>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Similar to the PVM-Integration, we need a small helping
program to start the daemons as a task on the slave nodes using the
qrsh-command. In some way, this start_mpich2 can be seen as a generic
program extending SGE with the ability to run a qrsh-command in the
background, which can easily be modified for similar startup methods. </p>
  <p>If you installed the whole package like suggested in
$SGE_ROOT/mpich2_mpd, set the working directory to
$SGE_ROOT/mpich2_mpd/src and compile the included program with:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>$ ./aimk<br>$ ./install.sh</pre>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The installation process will put the helping program mpich2_mpd
in a created directory $SGE_ROOT/mpich2_mpd/bin, which is the default
location of the included script startmpich2.sh to look for this
program. This helper program must be compiled for every platform you
have in the cluster, and on which you want to run this startup method.
A parallel environment for this startup method may look like:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>$ qconf -sp mpich2_mpd<br>pe_name            mpich2_mpd<br>slots              8<br>user_lists         NONE<br>xuser_lists        NONE<br>start_proc_args    /usr/sge/mpich2_mpd/startmpich2.sh -catch_rsh $pe_hostfile \<br>                   /home/reuti/local/mpich2-1.0.8/mpd<br>stop_proc_args     /usr/sge/mpich2_mpd/stopmpich2.sh -catch_rsh \<br>                   /home/reuti/local/mpich2-1.0.8/mpd<br>allocation_rule    $round_robin<br>control_slaves     TRUE<br>job_is_first_task  FALSE<br>urgency_slots      min<br>accounting_summary FALSE</pre>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Remember to attach this PE to a cluster queue of your choice and
to adjust the path to your MPICH installation. As the chain of Python
modules used in this startup method will create additonal processes and
processgroups, it&#8217;s essential to include in your cluster configuration
a special switch, which will kill the processes at the end of a job or
after an issued <span style="font-style: italic;">qdel</span> by
identifying the associated processes by an additonal group id, which is
attached to all spawned processes on a slave node (by default the
processgroup of the first started process by <span
 style="font-style: italic;">qrsh_starter</span> is used to kill just
this complete processgroup including its kids):<br>
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>$ qconf -sconf<br>...<br>execd_params                 ENABLE_ADDGRP_KILL=TRUE<br>...<br></pre>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Having done so, we can
now submit a job with the ususal sequence:<br>
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>$ qsub -pe mpich2_mpd 4 mpich2_mpd.sh</pre>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This will first start a local <span style="font-style: italic;">mpd</span>
process on the master node of the parallel job. Even this process will
be started by a local <span style="font-style: italic;">qrsh</span> in
the startmpich2.sh, so that the <span style="font-style: italic;">sge_shepherd</span>
will stay alive. After it was launched successfully, its used port will
be queried and the accompanying daemons on the slave nodes of the
parallel job will be started with this information.<br>
  </p>
  <p>The mpich2_mdp.sh will generate a *.po$JOB_ID like:<br>
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>$ cat mpich2.sh.po628<br>-catch_rsh /var/spool/sge/pc15381/active_jobs/628.1/pe_hostfile /home/reuti/local/mpich2-1.0.8/mpd<br>pc15381:2<br>pc15370:2<br>startmpich2.sh: check for local mpd daemon (1 of 10)<br>/usr/sge/bin/lx24-x86/qrsh -inherit -V pc15381 /home/reuti/local/mpich2-1.0.8/mpd/bin/mpd<br>startmpich2.sh: check for local mpd daemon (2 of 10)<br>startmpich2.sh: check for mpd daemons (1 of 10)<br>/usr/sge/bin/lx24-x86/qrsh -inherit -V pc15370 /home/reuti/local/mpich2-1.0.8/mpd/bin/mpd -h pc15381 -p 14581 -n<br>startmpich2.sh: check for mpd daemons (2 of 10)<br>startmpich2.sh: got all 2 of 2 nodes<br>-catch_rsh /home/reuti/local/mpich2-1.0.8/mpd<br></pre>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The first check will only look for the local <span
 style="font-style: italic;">mpd</span> daemon, i.e. whether it can
contact the local <span style="font-style: italic;">mpd</span> daemon
by a <span style="font-style: italic;">mpdtrace -l,</span> as we need
this information to instruct the other daemons to use the port which
was selected by the first started <span style="font-style: italic;">mpd</span>.
The
following loop will start the daemons on all remaining slave nodes, and
waits until all are up and running. After the startmpich2.sh the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">mpd</span> processes are available, and
the user program started by an <span style="font-style: italic;">mpiexec</span>
(or several) in the job script will spawn all processes to the already
running <span style="font-style: italic;">mpd</span>. On the master
node of the parallel job the following processes can be discovered:<br>
  </p>

  <p>The distribution of user processes is according to the granted

  <p>On the master node of the parallel job, the <span

as this is unfortunately hard-coded in several places in the MPICH2
source (it might change in version 1.1 of MPICH2 to honor the $TMPDIR
which is already set by SGE). To destinguish between several consoles
of the same user on a
node, the environment variable MPD_CON_EXT is set to reflect the
jobnumber and task-id of SGE in the name of the console file.<br>

<font size="+1"><b>Tight Integration of the daemonless smpd startup
method</b></font>
<blockquote>To compile MPICH2 for a smpd-based startup, it must first
be configured (after a <span style="font-style: italic;">make distclean</span>,
in case you just walked
through the <span style="font-style: italic;">mpd</span> startup
method before):
  <blockquote>
    <pre>$ ./configure --prefix=/home/reuti/local/mpich2-1.0.8/smpd --with-pm=smpd</pre>
  </blockquote>
  <p>and to get a Tight Integration we need a PE like the following
(including a -catch_rsh to the start script of the PE):</p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>$ qconf -sp mpich2_smpd_rsh<br>pe_name            mpich2_smpd_rsh<br>slots              8<br>user_lists         NONE<br>xuser_lists        NONE<br>start_proc_args    /usr/sge/mpich2_smpd_rsh/startmpich2.sh -catch_rsh \<br>                   $pe_hostfile<br>stop_proc_args     /usr/sge/mpich2_smpd_rsh/stopmpich2.sh<br>allocation_rule    $round_robin<br>control_slaves     TRUE<br>job_is_first_task  FALSE<br>urgency_slots      min<br>accounting_summary FALSE</pre>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Please lookup in the MPICH2 documentation, how to create a .smpd
file with a "phrase" in it. After submitting the job in exact the same
way as before (but this time taking the script mpich2_smpd_rsh.sh in
the qsub command):</p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>$ qsub -pe mpich2_smpd_rsh 4 mpich2_smpd_rsh.sh</pre>
  </blockquote>
  <p>you should see a distribution on the master node of your parallel

  <p>The important thing is, that the started script including the <i>mpiexec</i>
and the program <i>mpihello</i> are under full SGE control.</p>
  <p>(Side note: the default command compiled into MPICH2 this way is <span
 style="font-style: italic;">ssh -x</span>. You may replace this by
changing in the MPICH2 source
$MPICH2_ROOT/src/pm/smpd/mpiexec_rsh.c in the routine <i>mpiexec_rsh()</i>
the default value <span style="font-style: italic;">ssh -x</span> to a
plain <span style="font-style: italic;">rsh</span>, or change it each
time
during execution of your application program by setting the environment
variable &#8220;MPIEXEC_RSH=rsh; export MPIEXEC_RSH&#8221; to get access to a the
rsh-wrapper, like in the original MPICH implementation.)</p>

    <pre>$ qconf -sp mpich2_smpd<br>pe_name            mpich2_smpd<br>slots              8<br>user_lists         NONE<br>xuser_lists        NONE<br>start_proc_args    /usr/sge/mpich2_smpd/startmpich2.sh -catch_rsh $pe_hostfile \<br>                   /home/reuti/local/mpich2-1.0.8/smpd<br>stop_proc_args     /usr/sge/mpich2_smpd/stopmpich2.sh -catch_rsh \<br>                   /home/reuti/local/mpich2-1.0.8/smpd<br>allocation_rule    $round_robin<br>control_slaves     TRUE<br>job_is_first_task  FALSE<br>urgency_slots      min<br>accounting_summary FALSE</pre>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If we start the daemons on our own, we have to select a free port.
Although it maybe not safe in all cluster setups, the included formula
in startmpich2.sh, stopmpich2.sh and the demonstration submit script
mpich2_smpd.sh uses &#8220;$JOB_ID MOD 5000 + 20000&#8221; for the port.
Depending
on your job turnaround in your cluster, you may modify it in all
locations where it&#8217;s defined. To force the smpds not to fork themselves
into daemon land, they are started with the additional parameter &#8220;-d
0&#8221;. According to the MPICH2 team, this will not have any speed impact
(because the level of debugging is set to 0), but only prevent the
daemons from forking. Having this setup in a proper way, we can submit
the demonstration job:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>$ qsub -pe mpich2_smpd 4 mpich2_smpd.sh</pre>
  </blockquote>
  <p>and observe the distributed tasks on the nodes, after looking at
the selected nodes:</p>
  <blockquote>

  <p>The forked-off qrsh-commands by the startmpich2.sh (and
start_mpich2 program) are no longer bound to the starting script in
start_proc_args, but they are not consuming any CPU time or need to be
shut down during a qdel (they are just waiting for the shutdown of the
spawned daemons on the slave nodes). Important is, that the working
tasks of the <i>mpihello</i> are bound to the process chain, so that
the accounting will be correct, and also a controlled shutdown of the
daemons is possible. To give some feedback to the user of the started
tasks, the *.po$JOB_ID file will contain the check of the started
MPICH2 universe:</p>

  <p>If all is running fine, you may comment out these lines to shorten
the output a little bit and avoid any confusion to the user. Depending
of your personal taste, you may put the definition of your MPICH2 path
in a file like .bashrc, which will be sourced during a non-interactive
login.<br>
  </p>
  <p>Note: it is mandatory, that&nbsp; in your jobscript you include a
line "export SMPD_OPTION_NO_DYNAMIC_HOSTS=1" besides the port
identification. Otherwise, the node where the jobscript is running will
be added to your ~/.smpd. This will prevent a proper shutdown, although
this environment variable is already set during the start and stop of
the daemons in the appropriate scripts of the PE. Also the option -V
will be used in the accompanying skripts for this Howto.<br>
