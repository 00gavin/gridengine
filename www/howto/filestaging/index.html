<H1 CLASS="western">File-Staging approaches in Grid Engine</H1>
<P>Although Grid Engine is often used in an environment where NFS is
used to share files, sometimes it's useful to have a way of
transferring specific files associated with Grid jobs. Situations
where this is applicable could include:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Grids where NFS is not used on some or all compute hosts,
	either for performance or stability reasons</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P>cases where files have to be obtained from some remote
	system.  It's possible that not every host in the Grid has the
	ability to retrieve these files, due to connectivity, security, or
	bandwidth issues, but it would still be nice to have any compute
	host operate on them</P>
</UL>
<P>This HOWTO will cover two general cases for setting up
File-Staging in SGE.</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P><A HREF="#Local File-Staging|outline"><B>Local File-Staging</B></A>:
	this is when you wish to transfer files directly to the compute host
	on which a job will run</P>
	<LI><P><A HREF="#Site File-Staging|outline"><B>Site File-Staging</B></A>:
	this means that you need to obtain a file from outside the Grid and
	place it in a central repository, from which any compute host in the
	Grid can access it (via NFS or some secondary staging mechanism)</P>
</OL>
<HR>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="Local File-Staging|outline"></A>Local
File-Staging</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For non-NFS SGE clusters, file staging
can be provided by <B>prolog</B> and <B>epilog</B> methods. The
actual mechanism of file transfer will depend upon the local setup,
but here we outline the generic setup.  The &quot;remote&quot;
compute hosts are ones which do not share any NFS filesystems with
the master host or submit hosts.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This setup uses <CODE><B><I>rcp</I></B></CODE>
as the file transfer mechanism. The underlying permissions for <CODE>rcp</CODE>
need to be in place ahead of time. This includes:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">any potential submit host must be
	allowed to <CODE>rcp</CODE> to any potential compute host</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">vice versa, that is, any potential
	compute host must be allowed to <CODE>rcp</CODE> back to any
	potential submit host</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It is advisable that you first manually
test <CODE>rcp</CODE> between hosts before implementing the
file-staging procedure. Of course, the use of <CODE>rcp</CODE> is a
security concern. However, it should be straightforward to convert
this example to use <CODE>scp</CODE> instead of <CODE>rcp</CODE>.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">NOTE: the prototype will only work if
the submit user is known on the compute hosts, and if the submit
hostname is known to the compute host. These issues are independent
of file staging, but could present themselves in situations requiring
a file-staging solution.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Configuration</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The example given here is a simple job
which transfers an input text file to the compute host, converts all
characters to uppercase, and transfers the output file back to the
directory from which the input file was obtained.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The prototype consists of: the prolog
and epilog scripts, which run on the remote compute hosts, and a
sample job script which shows how to invoke the file transfer
facility.  The configuration is as follows:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">for queues on the compute hosts,
	set the prolog and epilog to be the scripts included here:<BR><CODE>prolog
	<A HREF="Local/file_trans_prlg.sh">file_trans_prlg.sh</A><BR>epilog
	<A HREF="Local/file_trans_eplg.sh">file_trans_eplg.sh</A></CODE></P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">use the sample jobs <CODE><A HREF="Local/changecase.sh">changecase.sh</A></CODE>
	as a model to create any arbitrary job script which makes use of
	stage-in/stage-out.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">submit the job as specified in the
	script.  You can use this file <CODE><A HREF="Local/song_of_wreck.txt">song_of_wreck.txt</A></CODE>
	as sample input.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It is recommended to use <CODE>$TMPDIR</CODE>
	as the working directory for staged files during a job run. This
	environment variable is automatically set by SGE to be a directory
	unique to every job. The directory and its contents are
	automatically deleted after the epilog completes.</P>
</UL>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The transfer of files from outside the
Grid to a local central repository can often times be a more
complicated task. Additionally, it might be possible that only
certain hosts in the grid are appropriate for doing this transfer
process. Maybe only these hosts have the ability to go outside the
firewall, or perhaps these hosts have high bandwidth to the network
or to the local storage. Finally, it could be possible that extremely
large files need to be transferred, eg, a large dataset from a public
archive.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this situation, the ideal approach
is to have the file transfer procedure be a separate job in Grid
Engine. The processing jobs which depend upon this data are then
submitted with a dependency on this <B>transfer job</B>. With this
setup, the transfer jobs can be configured to run only on those hosts
appropriate for this task, leaving your compute hosts free to do
other jobs, instead of being held up while the data transfer occurs.
By transferring to a central repository, you can then allow any
compute host to process the file.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Configuration</H3>
<P>In this second example, a transfer job is used to download
selected texts from the <B>Gutenberg Project</B> archive via <I>anoymous
ftp</I>. A processing job then does a word frequency analysis and
generates a report. The whole process is driven by a <B>submit
script</B>, which submits the two tasks with proper dependencies.</P>
<P>The setup is as follows:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>since we are using anoymous ftp to transfer files, we need a
	<CODE><A HREF="Site/netrc">.netrc</A></CODE> file in the user home
	directory in order to make the ftp scriptable. Rename the download
	to &ldquo;<CODE>.netrc&rdquo;</CODE> and place this file in the
	user's home directory with permissions 700.</P>
	<LI><P>the <CODE><A HREF="Site/transferjob.sh">transferjob.sh</A></CODE>
	script takes some arguments to specify which Gutenberg text to
	download and where to put it. The destination in this case should be
	an NFS directory available to all compute hosts. (NOTE: we are using
	the Gutenberg archive found at <B>ftp.cdrom.com</B>)</P>
	<LI><P>The <CODE><A HREF="Site/countword.pl">countwords.pl</A></CODE>
	script does the word frequency analysis for the file given as an
	argument.</P>
	<LI><P>The <CODE><A HREF="Site/submitscript.sh">submitscript.sh</A></CODE>
	script drives the process, and accepts as arguments the directory
	and filename from the Gutenberg archive</P>
</UL>
<P>Modify the scripts to match your environment.  It is recommended
that you first test the transfer job by itself from the command line,
to ensure that the anoymous ftp is working properly.</P>
