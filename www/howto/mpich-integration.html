<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Symptom of this behaviour</B></FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>You have parallel jobs using MPICH under SGE on LINUX.
   Some of these jobs are killed nicely when you use qdel and don't
   leave any running processes on the nodes behind. Other MPICH jobs
   are killed, but the calculating tasks are still present after the
   job is killed and consuming CPU time, while these jobs don't
   appear any longer in SGE.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

<HR>

<BR>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Explanation</B></FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Every MPICH task on a slave, created by an rsh-command,
   tries to become the process leader. If the MPICH task is just the
   child of qrsh_starter, this is okay as it is already the process
   leader and you can kill these jobs in the usual way. This is
   achieved, by killing the child of qrsh_starter with "kill (-pid)"
   and hence the whole process group will be killed. You can check
   this with the command:
   
   <PRE>&gt; ps f -eo pid,uid,gid,user,pgrp,command --cols=120</PRE>
   
   <P>If the startup script for the process on the slave nodes
   consists of at least two commands (like the startup with Myrinet
   on the nodes), a helping shell will be created,and the MPICH task
   will be a child of this shell with a new PID, but still in the
   same process group. The odd thing is now, that MPICH will discover
   this and enforce a new process group with this PID, to become the
   process leader. So the MPICH tasks jumps out of the creating
   process group and the intended kill of the started process group
   will fail, leaving the calculation tasks running.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

<HR>

<BR>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Solutions</B></FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>To solve this, there a various possibilities available,
   which you may chose so that it fits best to your setup of SGE.<BR>
   
   <P><B>1. Replace the helping shell with the MPICH task</B></P>
   
   <P>In case of e.g. Myrinet, the helping shell is created by one
   line in mpirun.ch_gm.pl:</P>
   
   <PRE>$cmdline = "cd $wdir ; env $varenv $apps_cmd&#91;$i&#93; $apps_flags&#91;$i&#93;";</PRE>
   
   <P>You can prefix the final call to your program with an "exec",
   so that the line looks like:</P>
   
   <PRE>$cmdline = "cd $wdir ; exec env $varenv $apps_cmd&#91;$i&#93; $apps_flags&#91;$i&#93;";</PRE>
   
   <P>With the "exec", the started program will replace the existing
   shell, and so will stay to be the process leader.<BR>
   </P>
   
   <P><B>2. Define MPICH_PROCESS_GROUP=no</B></P>
   
   <P>When this environment variable is defined, the startup of the
   MPICH task won't create a new process group. Where it must be
   defines, depends on the used version of the MPICH device:</P>
   
   <P><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=350 HEIGHT=40>
      <TR>
         <TD WIDTH=50>
            <P ALIGN=right>ch_p4:</P>
         </TD>
         <TD WIDTH=3>
            <P></P>
         </TD>
         <TD WIDTH=230>
            <P>must be set on the master node and the slaves</P>
         </TD>

      <TR>
         <TD WIDTH=50>
            <P ALIGN=right>Myrinet:</P>

      </TR>
   </TABLE>
   <BR>
   So you may define it in any file, which will be sourced during a
   noninteractive login to the slave nodes. To be set on the master
   node, you have to define it in the submit script. If you want to
   propagate this to the slave nodes (and avoid to change any login
   file), you will have to edit the rsh-wrapper in the mpi directory
   of SGE, so that the qrsh command used there will include -V, so
   that the variables are available on the slaves:</P>
   
   <PRE><CODE>echo $SGE_ROOT/bin/$ARC/qrsh -inherit -nostdin $rhost $cmd
exec $SGE_ROOT/bin/$ARC/qrsh -inherit -nostdin $rhost $cmd
else
echo $SGE_ROOT/bin/$ARC/qrsh -inherit $rhost $cmd
exec $SGE_ROOT/bin/$ARC/qrsh -inherit $rhost $cmd</CODE></PRE>
   
   <P>should read:</P>
   
   <PRE>echo $SGE_ROOT/bin/$ARC/qrsh -V -inherit -nostdin $rhost $cmd
exec $SGE_ROOT/bin/$ARC/qrsh -V -inherit -nostdin $rhost $cmd
else
echo $SGE_ROOT/bin/$ARC/qrsh -V -inherit $rhost $cmd
exec $SGE_ROOT/bin/$ARC/qrsh -V -inherit $rhost $cmd<BR></PRE>
   
   <P><B>3. Recompile MPICH</B></P>
   
   <P>When you have the source of the used programs, it is also
   possible to disable the creation of a new process group from MPICH
   and remove this behaviour completely.<BR>
   </P>
   
   <BLOCKQUOTE><B>For MPICH 1.2.5.2 and 1.2.6:</B>
      
      <P>The file where it must be done is session.c in
      mpich-1.2.5.2/mpid/util. Change the line:</P>
      
      <PRE>#if defined(HAVE_SETSID) &amp;&amp; defined(HAVE_ISATTY) &amp;&amp; defined(SET_NEW_PGRP)</PRE>
      
      <P>to</P>
      
      <PRE>#if defined(HAVE_SETSID) &amp;&amp; defined(HAVE_ISATTY) &amp;&amp; defined(SET_NEW_PGRP) &amp;&amp; 0</PRE>
      
      <P>This way you can easily go back at a later point in
      time.<BR>
      </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
   
   <P>Because the routine will be linked into your final program, you
   have to recompile all your programs. It's not sufficient, just to
   install this new version in /usr/lib (or your path to mpich),
   unless you have used the shared libraries of MPICH. Whether any
   delivered binary from a vendor uses the shared version of MPICH,
   or has them statically linked in, you can check with the LINUX
   command ldd.</P>
   
   <P>Before you run ./configure for MPICH, you should export the
   variable RSHCOMMAND=rsh, to get the desired rsh command compiled
   into the libraries. To create shared libraries and use them during
   compilation of a MPICH program, please refer to the MPICH
   documentation.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Number of tasks spread to the nodes</B></FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>There is a difference, how many calls to qrsh will be
   made depending on the used version of MPICH. If you use MPICH with
   the ch_p4 device over ethernet, there will always be the first
   task started locally without usage of any qrsh call. Instead (n-1)
   times will qrsh only be called. Hence you can set
   "job_is_first_task" to true in the definition of your PE and allow
   only (n-1) calls to qrsh by your job.
   
   <P>If you are using Myrinet, it's different. In this case exactly
   n times the qrsh will be used. So set the "job_is_first_task" to
   false.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

<BR>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>What rsh command is compiled into a
binary?</B></FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>If you got only the binary from a vendor, and your are in
   doubt what rsh command was compiled into the program, you can try
   to get some more information with:
   
   <PRE>&gt; strings &lt;programname&gt; | awk ' /(rsh|ssh)/ { print } '</PRE>
   
   <P>This may give you more information than you like, but you
   should at least get some clue about it.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

<HR>

<BR>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Option -nolocal to mpirun</B></FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>You should avoid setting this option, neither in any
   mpirun.args script, nor as option to the command. The first
   problem would be, that the head node of the MPI job (this is not
   the master node, but one of the selected slaves) will not be used
   at all, and so the processes will only be spread to the other
   nodes in the list (if you got just 2 slots on one machine it can't
   run at all this way). The second problem will be the used rsh
   command: because the first rsh command is just to start the head
   node (which would be on a slave this way), the setting of
   P4_RSHCOMMAND is ignored.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Uneven distribution of processes to the slave
nodes with two network cards</B></FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>As Andreas pointed out in <A HREF="http://gridengine.sunsource.net/servlets/ReadMsg?msgId=15741&listName=users">http://gridengine.sunsource.net/servlets/ReadMsg?msgId=15741&amp;listName=users</A>,
   you have to check whether the first scan of the machines file by
   MPICH can remove an entry at all, because `hostname` may give a
   different name than included in the machines file (because you are
   using a host_aliases file). Depending on your setup of the
   cluster, it may be necessary to change just one entry back to the
   one delivered by `hostname`. If you change all entries back to the
   external interface again, you program may use the wrong network
   for the communication by MPICH. This may, or may not, be the
   desired result. Code to change just one entry back to the
   `hostname` is a small addition to the PeHostfile2MachineFile
   subroutine in startmpi.sh:
   
   <PRE>PeHostfile2MachineFile()
{
    myhostname=`hostname`
    myalias=`grep $myhostname $SGE_ROOT/default/common/host_aliases | cut -f 1 -d " "`
   
    cat $1 | while read line; do
        # echo $line
       host=`echo $line|cut -f1 -d" "|cut -f1 -d"."`
       nslots=`echo $line|cut -f2 -d" "`
       i=1
       while &#91; $i -le $nslots &#93;; do
          # add here code to map regular hostnames into ATM hostnames
   
          if &#91; $host = "$myalias" &#93; ; then  # be sure to include " for the second argument
              echo $myhostname
              unset myalias
          else
              echo $host
          fi
   
          i=`expr $i + 1`
       done
    done
}</PRE>
   
   <P>Don't include this, if you already changed the startmpi.sh for
   the handling of Turbomole, you would get two times the external
   name. In general, I prefer having one PE for each application.
   Thus copy the mpi folder in $SGE_ROOT and name it e.g. turbo, adf,
   linda etc. and create corresponding PEs.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Wrong interface selected for the back channel of
the MPICH-tasks with the ch_p4-device</B></FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>With the hints given above, you may achieve the goal of
   an even distribution of your MPICH tasks, but the used network
   interfaces for the communication of the slave processes to the
   master node may be the wrong one. You will notice this, when you
   have a look at the program calls to the slave processes. Assume
   'ic...' is the internal network (which should be used) and
   'node...' the external one for the NFS traffic. Then the call:
   
   <PRE>rsh ic002 -l user -x -n /home/user/a.out node001 31052 \-p4amslave \-p4yourname ic002 \-p4rmrank 1 </PRE>
   
   <P>will use the wrong interface for the information sent back to
   the master. It should have the form:</P>
   
   <PRE>rsh ic002 -l user -x -n /home/user/a.out ic001 33813 \-p4amslave \-p4yourname ic002 \-p4rmrank 1</PRE>
   
   <P>This can be changed, when you set and export the $MPI_HOST
   environment variable by hand before the call to mpirun to be the
   name of the internal interface on the execution node, and not the
   (default) `hostname` for the external interface. You can also do
   it for all users in the mpich.args where $MPI_HOST will be set, if
   it was unset before the call to mpirun and change:</P>
   
   <PRE>MPI_HOST=`hostname`</PRE>
   
   <P>to:</P>
   
   <PRE>MPI_HOST=`grep $(hostname) $SGE_ROOT/default/common/host_aliases | cut -f 1 -d " "`</PRE>
   
   <P>In case that you don't use a host_aliases file at all, but
   still want to change to another interface, you can e.g. use a sed
   command like:</P>
   
   <PRE>MPI_HOST=`hostname | sed "s/^node/ic/"`</PRE>
   
   <P>If you decide to use this way, then take care with given "Hint
   for Turbomole" because you also have to take in account the
   internal hostname there and use it. Or you will not have to apply
   the change of "Uneven Distribution of processes...", if you
   already changed the $MPI_HOST for mpirun. This all highly depends
   on your setup of your cluster and desired use of your network
   interfaces. So this all <I>might</I> only be places, where you
   <I>can</I> change your setup; there is no golden rule, which will
   fit for all configurations. Just implement them and have a look at
   some test jobs, how they are distributed to the nodes and which
   interfaces they are using.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Hint for ADF</B></FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Some programs (like ADF parallel with MPICH) have a hard
   coded /usr/bin/rsh inside for their rsh command. To access any
   wrapper and let SGE take control over the slaves, you <B>must</B>
   set:
   
   <PRE>export P4_RSHCOMMAND=rsh</PRE>
   
   <P>in the job script. Otherwise, always the built in /usr/bin/rsh
   will be used. For the usage of ssh please refer to the the
   appropriate HowTo for ssh, and leave the settings for MPICH to rsh
   to access the rsh-wrapper of SGE, which will then use ssh in the
   end.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

<HR>

<BR>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Hint for Turbomole</B></FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Turbomole is using the ch_p4 device of MPICH. But due to
   the fact, that this program will always startup one slave process
   more (as server task without CPU load) than parallel slots
   requested, you have to set "job_is_first_task" to false, to allow
   this qrsh call to be made. As mentioned above, MPICH will make
   only (n-1) calls to qrsh, but Turbomole will request (n+1) tasks,
   so that you end up with n again.
   
   <P>Because one call more to qrsh is made by TURBOMOLE than SGE is
   aware of (because of the behaviour of MPICH to start one task
   locally without qrsh, but still removing one line during the first
   scan of the machines file), the created machines file on the
   master node will have one line less than necessary. This yields to
   a second scan of the machines file, starting at the beginning. If
   the first line in the machines file is also the master node where
   the server task for Turbomole is running, all is in best order,
   because there is already the server process running which doesn't
   use any CPU time, and another working slave task is welcome. But
   in all other cases, you will have the slave processes uneven
   distributed to the slave nodes. Therefore just add one line to the
   startmpi.sh in the $SGE_ROOT/mpi directory in the already
   existing, to create one entry more with the name of the master
   node:</P>
   
   <PRE>if &#91; $unique = 1 &#93;; then
    PeHostfile2MachineFile $pe_hostfile | uniq &gt;&gt; $machines
else
    PeHostfile2MachineFile $pe_hostfile &gt;&gt; $machines
   
#
# Append own hostname to the machines file.
#
   
    echo `hostname` &gt;&gt; $machines
fi</PRE>
   
   <P>This has the positive side effect, to deliver one entry in the
   machines file which can be at least removed at all during the
   first scan by MPICH. It will remove the line with `hostname`. If
   there is none, nothing is removed. This may be the case, when you
   have two network cards in the slaves, and `hostname` gives the
   name of the external interface, but the created hostlist by SGE
   contains only the internal names.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
