MySQL Database Software
=======================

ARCo uses views and therefore it supports MySQL database of version 5.0.x and higher (previous versions of MySQL database doesn't support views. 
Detailed information on the MySQL database software can be found in the MySQL documentation http://dev.mysql.com/doc/index.html. 

ARCo is a java web based application and needs the jdbc driver for converting jdbc calls into the network protocol used by the MySQL database. 
You can download the jdbc driver at http://www.mysql.com/products/connector.

Case sensitivity in MySQL database:
===================================
In MySQL, databases correspond to directories within the data directory. Each table within a database corresponds to at least one file 
within the database directory (and possibly more, depending on the storage engine). Consequently, the case sensitivity of the underlying 
operating system determines the case sensitivity of database and table names. This means database and table names are case sensitive 
in most varieties of Unix, and not case sensitive in Windows.

Installation of MySQL database on UNIX systems
==============================================

1. step: Select the appropriate installation version for your system on http://www.mysql.com and download it. Standard installation directory 
for UNIX systems is /usr/local/mysql, if you install it into a different directory, you have to change the settings for the scripts provided 
in the package.

Create the symbolic link:
# ln -s ${installation_directory}/mysql-standard-5.0.26-solaris10-i386 mysql

You will find several files and subdirectories in the mysql directory. The most important for installation purposes are the bin and scripts 
subdirectories:

* The bin directory contains client programs and the server.

* The scripts directory contains the mysql_install_db script used to initialize the 'mysql' database containing the grant tables that store 
  the server access permissions.

MySQL programs:

1) The MySQL server and server startup scripts:
* mysqld is the MySQL server.
* mysqld_safe, mysql.server, and mysqld_multi are server startup scripts.
* mysql_install_db initializes the data directory and the initial databases.
* mysqlmanager MySQL instance manager.

2) Client programs that access the server:
* mysql is a command-line client for executing SQL statements interactively or in batch mode.
* mysqladmin is an administrative client.
* mysqlcheck performs table maintenance operations.
* mysqldump and mysqlhotcopy make database backups.
* mysqlimport imports data files.
* mysqlshow displays information about databases and tables.

3) Utility programs that operate independently of the server:
* myisamchk performs table maintenance operations.
* myisampack produces compressed, read-only tables.
* mysqlbinlog is a tool for processing binary log files.
* perror displays the meaning of error codes.

2. step: Add a login user and group for mysqld to run as:
# groupadd mysql
# useradd -g mysql mysql

3. step: Create the MySQL grant tables:
# cd /usr/local/mysql                       [ mysql installation directory ]
# scripts/mysql_install_db --user=mysql

4. step: Change the ownership of program binaries to 'root' and ownership of the data directory to the user that you run mysqld as.
# chown -R root ${installation_directory}/mysql-standard-5.0.26-solaris10-i386
# chown -R mysql ${installation_directory}/mysql-standard-5.0.26-solaris10-i386/data
# chgrp -R mysql ${installation_directory}/mysql-standard-5.0.26-solaris10-i386

5. step: Configure MySQL server to use InnoDB as the default storage engine
MySQL supports several storage engines that act as handlers for different table types. MySQL storage engines 
include both, those that handle transaction-safe tables, and those that handle non-transaction-safe tables. 
ARCo installation requires the use of transaction-safe tables.

Edit the my.cnf file and set the option default_storage_engine=innodb
Configure other innodb properties such as innodb_data_home_dir, innodb_data_file_path. 

For details on InnoDB storage configuration refer to: 
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/innodb-configuration.html
         
6. step: Start the MySQL server
# bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &

7. step: Set up the root password
# ./bin/mysqladmin -u root password 'new-password'
# ./bin/mysqladmin -u root -h ${hostname} password 'new-password'

8. step: Verify that your database is configured with the correct storage engine
Create a test table (see examples below) and issue an sql command:
SHOW TABLE STATUS FROM <database_name> LIKE '<test_table_name>'

The field 'Engine' should have a value InnoDB.

Tips:
=====
* Copy support-files/mysql.server to /etc/init.d and link it to /etc/rc3.d/S99mysql and /etc/rc0.d/K01mysql to start MySQL server at boot time.
  Change the basedir and datadir variables if not installed in /usr/local/mysql.
* Add the full pathname of this directory to your PATH environment variable so that your shell finds the MySQL programs properly.

Examples of usage of mysql command:
-----------------------------------
# mysql --help
# mysql  -h <host> -u <user> -p <database_name> -p<my_password>
# mysql <  batch_file_path  [ # mysql < batch_file_path | more , # mysql < batch_file_path > mysql.out

mysql> SHOW VARIABLES; ... list the environment variables
mysql> SELECT USER(); 
+----------------------+
| user()               |
+----------------------+
| arco_write@localhost |
+----------------------+
1 row in set (0.19 sec)

mysql> SELECT VERSION(); 
+-----------------+
| version()       |
+-----------------+
| 5.0.26-standard |
+-----------------+
1 row in set (0.02 sec)

Databases: 

mysql> SHOW DATABASES; ... show all databases
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| arco               |
| mysql              |
| test               |
+--------------------+
4 rows in set (0.23 sec)

mysql> CREATE DATABASE <database_name>; ... create new database
mysql> USE <database_name>; ... select the database to use
mysql> SELECT DATABASE();  ... currently used database

mysql> SHOW TABLES;
mysql> CREATE TABLE <table_name> (<column1> <column1_type>, <column2> <column2_type>, ...);
mysql> DESCRIBE <table_name>;
mysql> SHOW INDEX FROM <table_name>;
mysql> INSERT INTO <table_name> VALUES (...);
mysql> UPDATE <table_name> SET <column_name1> = '<column_value1>' WHERE <column_name2> = '<column_value2>'
mysq>DELETE FROM <table_name>

Account management:

mysql> CREATE USER user [IDENTIFIED BY [PASSWORD] 'password'] [, user [IDENTIFIED BY [PASSWORD] 'password']] ...
mysql> DROP USER user [, user] ...

MySQL privileges system:

- identification in MySQL database: username & hostname
 
mysql> use information_schema;
mysql> select * from user_privileges; [ mysql> show tables for more information ]

mysql> show grants for '<username>'@'<hostname>';
mysql> GRANT ALL ON <database_name>.* TO '<your_mysql_name>'@'<your_client_host>';
mysql> REVOKE ALL ON *.* FROM <username>;

mysql> QUIT [\q]

How to Set Up ARCo database:
===============================

1. step: Log in to the MySQL console as a superuser
# mysql -u root -p<password>

2. step: Create user arco_write:

mysql> GRANT ALL on *.* to 'arco_write'@'<database_host>' identified by '<password>' with GRANT OPTION;
mysql> GRANT ALL on *.* to 'arco_write'@'%' identified by '<password>' with GRANT OPTION;

3. Exit MySQL console.
mysql> \q

4. step: Log in to the MySQL console as a arco_write user:
# mysql -u arco_write -p<password>

5. step: Create arco database:
mysql> CREATE DATABASE <db_name>;

6. step: Create user arco_read and grant privileges for arco_read:
mysql> GRANT SELECT,SHOW VIEW on <db_name>.* to 'arco_read'@'<database_host>' identified by '<password>';
mysql> GRANT SELECT,SHOW VIEW on <db_name>.* to 'arco_read'@'%' identified by '<password>';

Note: 'arco_read'@'%' have to be created. If the MySQL database host is the same as the host where 
the Java Web Console with ARCo is running, you need to create also a user 'arco_read'@'<database_host>'.
 
7. step: Copy the mysql jdbc driver into the $SGE_ROOT/dbwriter/lib/ and $SGE_ROOT/reporting/WEB-INF/lib/
         directories.

8. step: Install the Accounting and Reporting Software
