1) Who needs to read this document
----------------------------------

   This document describes how to install a Grid Engine 6.2 Update release
   from a previous 6.2 revision.

   If you make a new installation of Grid Engine 6.2 or a newer update
   release please follow the directions in the Sun Grid Engine manuals which
   can be found at http://wikis.sun.com/display/gridengine62u5/Home

   The terms "update release", "patch", "patch release", and "distribution"
   in this document are used interchangeably and refer to the most recent
   courtesy distribution of Grid Engine which includes binaries,
   documentation and architecture independent files (the "common" package)
   available on the binary download page.


2) Prerequisites
-----------------

   The courtesy binary distribution always contains a full set of all
   binaries.

   These installation instructions assume that you are running a homogenous
   Grid Engine cluster (called "the software") where all hosts share the
   same directory for the binaries. If you are running the software in a
   heterogenous environment (mix of different binary architectures), you
   need to apply the patch installation for all binary architectures as well
   as the "common" and "arco" packages.

   If you installed the software on local filesystems, you need to install
   all relevant patches on all hosts where you installed the software
   locally.

   By default, there should by no running jobs when the patch is installed.
   There may pending batch jobs, but no pending interactive jobs (qrsh,
   qmake, qsh, qtcsh).

   It is possible to install the patch with running batch jobs. To avoid a
   failure (and possible loss of your jobs) of a running 'sge_shepherd'
   process, it is necessary to move the old sge_shepherd binary (and copy it
   back prior to the installation of the patch).

   You cannot install the patch with running interactive jobs, 'qmake' jobs
   or with running parallel jobs which use the tight integration support
   (control_slaves=true in PE configuration is set).

   It is required to update all binaries and the "common" package to the
   same revision level. A mix if different versions of Grid Engine daemons
   and commands is not supported.


3. Stopping the Grid Engine cluster to prevent start of jobs
------------------------------------------------------------

   Disable all queues so that no new jobs are started:

      # qmod -d '*'

   Optional (only needed if there are running jobs which should continue to
   run when the patch is installed):

      # cd $SGE_ROOT/bin
      # mv <arch>/sge_shepherd <arch>/sge_shepherd.sge61

   It is important that the binary is moved with the "mv" command. It should
   not be copied because this could cause the crash of an active shepherd
   process which is currently running job when the patch is installed.


4. Shutting down the Grid Engine qmaster, scheduler and execution daemons
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

   You need to shutdown (and restart) the qmaster and scheduler daemon and
   all running execution daemons.

   Shutdown all your execution hosts. Login to all your execution hosts and
   stop the execution daemons:

      # /etc/init.d/sgeexecd softstop

   Then login to your qmaster machine and stop qmaster and scheduler:

      # /etc/init.d/sgemaster stop

   Now verify with the 'ps' command that all Grid Engine daemons on all
   hosts are stopped. If you decided to rename the 'sge_shepherd' binary so
   that running jobs can continue to run during the patch installation, you
   must not kill the 'sge_shepherd' binary (process).


5. Installing the patch and restarting the software
---------------------------------------------------

   Now install the update release by unpacking all 'tar.gz' files (all
   binary packages and the "common" package).


6. Restarting the software
--------------------------

   Please login to your qmaster machine and execution hosts and enter:

      # /etc/init.d/sgemaster etc/init.d/sgeexecd

   After restarting the software, you may again enable your queues:

      # qmod -e '*'

   If you renamed the shepherd binary, you may safely delete the old binary
   when all jobs which where running prior the patch installation have
   finished.
