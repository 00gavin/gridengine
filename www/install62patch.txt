1) Who needs to read this document
----------------------------------

   This document describes how to install a Grid Engine 6.2 Update release
   from a previous 6.2 revision.

   If you make a new installation of Grid Engine 6.2 or a newer update
   release please follow the directions in the Sun Grid Engine manuals which
   can be found at http://wikis.sun.com/display/gridengine62u2/Home

   The terms "update release", "patch", "patch release", and "distribution"
   in this document are used interchangeably and refer to the most recent
   courtesy distribution of Grid Engine which includes binaries,
   documentation and architecture independent files (the "common" package)
   available on the binary download page.


2) Prerequisites
-----------------

   The courtesy binary distribution always contains a full set of all
   binaries.

   These installation instructions assume that you are running a homogenous
   Grid Engine cluster (called "the software") where all hosts share the
   same directory for the binaries. If you are running the software in a
   heterogenous environment (mix of different binary architectures), you
   need to apply the patch installation for all binary architectures as well
   as the "common" and "arco" packages.

   If you installed the software on local filesystems, you need to install
   all relevant patches on all hosts where you installed the software
   locally.

   By default, there should by no running jobs when the patch is installed.
   There may pending batch jobs, but no pending interactive jobs (qrsh,
   qmake, qsh, qtcsh).

   It is possible to install the patch with running batch jobs. To avoid a
   failure (and possible loss of your jobs) of a running 'sge_shepherd'
   process, it is necessary to move the old sge_shepherd binary (and copy it
   back prior to the installation of the patch).

   You cannot install the patch with running interactive jobs, 'qmake' jobs
   or with running parallel jobs which use the tight integration support
   (control_slaves=true in PE configuration is set).

   It is required to update all binaries and the "common" package to the
   same revision level. A mix if different versions of Grid Engine daemons
   and commands is not supported.


3. Stopping the Grid Engine cluster to prevent start of jobs
------------------------------------------------------------

   Disable all queues so that no new jobs are started:

      # qmod -d '*'

   Optional (only needed if there are running jobs which should continue to
   run when the patch is installed):

      # cd $SGE_ROOT/bin
      # mv <arch>/sge_shepherd <arch>/sge_shepherd.sge61

   It is important that the binary is moved with the "mv" command. It should
   not be copied because this could cause the crash of an active shepherd
   process which is currently running job when the patch is installed.


4. Shutting down the Grid Engine qmaster, scheduler and execution daemons
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

   You need to shutdown (and restart) the qmaster and scheduler daemon and
   all running execution daemons.

   Shutdown all your execution hosts. Login to all your execution hosts and
   stop the execution daemons:

      # /etc/init.d/sgeexecd softstop

   Then login to your qmaster machine and stop qmaster and scheduler:

      # /etc/init.d/sgemaster stop

   Now verify with the 'ps' command that all Grid Engine daemons on all
   hosts are stopped. If you decided to rename the 'sge_shepherd' binary so
   that running jobs can continue to run during the patch installation, you
   must not kill the 'sge_shepherd' binary (process).


5. Installing the patch and restarting the software
---------------------------------------------------

   Now install the update release by unpacking all 'tar.gz' files (all
   binary packages and the "common" package).


6. Restarting the software
--------------------------

   Please login to your qmaster machine and execution hosts and enter:

      # /etc/init.d/sgemaster etc/init.d/sgeexecd

   After restarting the software, you may again enable your queues:

      # qmod -e '*'

   If you renamed the shepherd binary, you may safely delete the old binary
   when all jobs which where running prior the patch installation have
   finished.


7. New functionality delivered with SGE 6.2 Update 2 release
------------------------------------------------------------

   GUI Installer
   ------------
   Sun Grid Engine 6.2u2 comes with a new GUI installer to simplify the
   installation process. The GUI installer enables you to easily install a
   whole cluster interactively. To install a cluster, you need to set up the
   environment in a similar way to an automatic installation.

   Microsoft Windows Vista Support
   -------------------------------
   New support for 32-bit and 64-bit editions of Microsoft Windows Vista
   (Enterprise and Ultimate Edition), Windows Server 2003R2 and Windows Server
   2008.

   Job Submission Verifiers (JSVs)
   -------------------------------
   JSVs allow users and administrators to define rules that determine which
   jobs are allowed to enter into a cluster and which jobs should be rejected
   immediately. A JSV is a script or binary that can be used to verify, modify,
   or reject a job during the time of job submission or on the master host.

   Consumable Resources Per Job
   ----------------------------
   Consumable complex attributes can now be configured as per job. Such
   consumables are consumed as requested and are no longer multiplied by the
   requested slots. This makes resource requests for parallel jobs much easier
   to define, especially when using slot ranges.

   jemalloc Library
   ----------------
   Linux distributions (x64 platforms) come with a default memory allocator
   library which is not as efficient as the open source jemalloc memory
   allocator library also used by the Firefox browser. SGE 6.2 Update 2
   replaces the native Linux malloc library with the jemalloc library. This has
   a positive effect on the master host performance in large and high
   throughput Sun Grid Engine clusters on Linux and reduces the memory
   footprint up to 20%. This will lead to a significant performance increase.
