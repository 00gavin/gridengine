      <p>2. RESTRICTIONS Software is confidential and
copyrighted. Title to Software and all associated intellectual property
rights is retained by Sun and/or its licensors. Except as specifically

or trade name of Sun or its licensors is granted under this Agreement.</p>

period of ninety (90) days from the date of purchase, as evidenced by a
copy of the receipt, the media on which Software is furnished (if any)
will be free of defects in materials and workmanship under normal use.

AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS

THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO BE LEGALLY INVALID.</p>

      <p>5. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED
BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST
REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL,
INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY
OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO
USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES. In no event will Sun's liability to you, whether in contract,
tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount paid by
you for Software under this Agreement. The foregoing limitations will
apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its essential purpose.</p>

      <p>6. Termination. This Agreement is effective until
terminated. You may terminate this Agreement at any time by destroying
all copies of Software. This Agreement will terminate immediately

being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S. Government or by a U.S.
Government prime contractor or subcontractor (at any tier), then the

will be governed by California law and controlling U.S. federal law. No
choice of law rules of any jurisdiction will apply.</p>

held to be unenforceable, this Agreement will remain in effect with the
provision omitted, unless omission would frustrate the intent of the
parties, in which case this Agreement will immediately terminate.</p>

      <p>11. Integration. This Agreement is the entire agreement
between you and Sun relating to its subject matter. It supersedes all
prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals,
representations and warranties and prevails over any conflicting or
additional terms of any quote, order, acknowledgment, or other
