<h3>
<font color="#CC3300">Grid Engine Interoperability</font></h3>
The project has an objective to facilitate the deployment of compute farms
enabled with Grid Engine binaries obtained from multiple sources. Interoperability
of Grid Engine binaries is required to facilitate this objective.
<p>If you are providing your compiled Grid Engine binaries to others, it
is a requirement of the license to validate that your compiled binaries
can interoperate with a Reference Build of the software. Interoperability
is determined through a Compatibility Test.
<p>If you are creating Grid Engine binaries for your own internal use,
there are no requirements for testing. However, interoperability testing
is a recommended practice if you will be incorporating binaries created
by others.
<h3>
<font color="#CC3300">Open Standards for DRM</font></h3>
Open standards for DRM software, developed through a community process
with DRM users and developers, holds the promise of reduced setup and maintenance
tasks for end users. As the Grid Engine project develops specifications
with the community, these specifications will be incorporated into the
project standards and referenced in this file.&nbsp;
<h3>
<font color="#CC3300">Grid Engine Reference Builds and Compatibility Testing</font></h3>
A Grid Engine Reference Build is a designated binary build of the software
that acts as a reference for all interoperability testing for that version
of the software. Two references have been chosen to increase the likelyhood
of having access to a suitable platform. Reference Builds will be redesignated
periodically to correspond with significant build versions, and will be
referenced in this file.
<p>Interoperability is confirmed through successful completion of a <a href="http://gridengine.sunsource.net/unbranded-source/browse/~checkout~/gridengine/doc/compatibility_test.html?content-type=text/html">Compatibility
Test</a>, wherein you test your compiled binaries against a Reference Build.
These tests are version-specific and correspond to Reference Builds of
the same version.&nbsp;</td>
