<B>Grid Engine standards for interoperability</B></font>

<P>This page describes the approach in the project to facilitate the successful use by
an end user of Grid Engine binaries obtained from more than one project participant.</p>

<p>The Grid Engine project has objectives to develop Distributed Resource Management 
(DRM) software and to facilitate an expansion of the IT infrastructure around 
distributed computing. Interoperability of Grid Engine components and heterogeneous platform support can

<B>Open Standards for DRM</B></font>
<p>The Sun Industry Standards Source License selected for the Grid Engine project 
provides the community a mechanism to evolve open standards in support the use of
distributed computing and DRM software. Open standards for DRM software will be 
especially useful for tight integration with application software and interoperability 
of Grid Engine software components from different sources, which are expected scenarios 
as the use of Grid Engine and distributed computing increases.</p>



<p>You can use CVS to access the Grid Engine source code. You need to have a CVS client. Most Linux machines by default, have the command-line client
installed. You might also want to visit the 
<A HREF="http://www.cvshome.org/">CVS Web site</A>, which <A HREF="http://www.cvshome.org/dev/codes.html">lists</A> the available CVS clients for different
platforms, their strengths, and weaknesses.
You also need to read the Cederqvist manual that  includes most CVS clients that are used for general information. Tips on this page will assume
command-line usage on UNIX&reg; using Bourne shell.

<DT><A href="DomainDocsCVS.html">CVS source code version control</A>
<DD>The <B>Concurrent Versions System (CVS)</B> is a widely used version control tool for tracking all modifications to project source code
files. Developers 
can work on the same files and coordinate their contributions through a common repository.

<br><br>

<DT><A href="DomainDocsSourceBrowse.html">CVSWeb source code browsing</A>
<DD><B>CVSWeb</B> source code browsing gives project contributors a graphical, browser-based tool to view project files, version histories, and directory
structures. 

<br><br>

<DT><A href="DomainDocsIssues.html">IssueZilla issue tracking</A>
<DD><B>IssueZilla</B> is a customizable open source tool for reporting, tracking, and managing all project tasks, defects, features, enhancements, and
patches.

<br><br>

<DT><A href="DomainDocsMailingLists.html">Mailing list management and archiving</A>
<DD>Two open-source mail tools -- <B>anzu</B> and <B>eyebrowse</B> -- provide powerful, scalable functionality to administer, moderate, customize, and
archive project mailing lists.

<br><br>

<DT><A href="DomainDocsSSHGuide.html">Tunneling with SSH</A>
<DD><B>SSH</B> provides the security that is required by software development projects. SSH can be used to create a transparent "port tunnel" to the CVS 
(concurrent versions system) server, unobtrusively insuring the security of the data exchanged.</font></DD>
