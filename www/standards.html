<P>The project has an objective to facilitate the 
deployment of compute farms enabled with Grid Engine binaries 
obtained from multiple sources. Interoperability of Grid Engine 
binaries is required to facilitate this objective.</p>

<p>If you are providing your compiled Grid Engine binaries to others, 
it is a requirement of the license to validate that your compiled binaries can 
interoperate with a Reference Build of the software. 
Interoperability is determined through a Compatibility Test.</p> 

<p> If you are creating Grid Engine binaries for your own internal
use, there are no requirements for testing. However, interoperability
testing is a recommended practice if you will be incorporating binaries created
by others.</p>


<H3><font color="#990000">Open Standards for DRM</font></H3></font>
<p>Open standards for DRM software, developed through a community process with DRM users and
developers, holds the promise of reduced setup and maintenance tasks for end users. As the Grid 
Engine project develops specifications with the community, these specifications will
be incorporated into the project standards and referenced in this file. </p>

<H3><font color="#990000">Grid Engine Reference Builds and Compatibility Testing</font></H3></font>

<p>A Grid Engine Reference Build is a designated binary build of the software
that acts as a reference for all interoperability testing for that version of the 
software. Two references have been chosen to increase the likelyhood of having 
access to a suitable platform. Reference Builds will be redesignated
periodically to correspond with significant build versions, and will be referenced in this 
file.</p>

<p> Interoperability is confirmed through successful completion of a Compatability Test,
wherein you will test your compiled binaries against a Reference Build.  
These tests are version-specific and correspond to a Reference Build. </p>

<p>The list below is sorted in last-first order, i.e. the most recent Reference Builds are at the top:
