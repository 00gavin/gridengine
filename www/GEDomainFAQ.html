      <b>Q: What is Grid Engine?</b>
      <p><b>A: </b>Grid Engine is a Distributed Resource Management (DRM) software.
DRM software aggregates compute power and delivers it as a network service.
Grid Engine software is used with a set of computers to create powerful
compute farms, which are used in a wide range of technical computing applications
such as the development of semiconductors, bioinformatics, mechanical design,
software development, oil/gas exploration, and financial analysis; additionally,
massively scaling supercomputers use Grid Engine software in a variety
of academic and research pursuits. Users enjoy access to large computing
capability and organizations enjoy effective utilization of their computing
resource investments approaching 100%.
      </p>
      <p><b>Q: How can Grid Engine can help me?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>A: </b>Grid Engine is helpful in three elementary ways. It can:
      </p>
      <ul>

        <li>
optimally place computing tasks and balance the load on a set of networked
computers</li>


        <li>
allow users to generate and queue more computing tasks than can be run
at the moment</li>


        <li>
ensure that tasks are executed with respect to priority and to providing
all users with a fair share of access over time</li>

      </ul>

Essentially Grid Engine presents users a seamless, integrated computing
capability. Grid Engine is used to support a wide variety of requirements;
for instance, where users start many interactive and batch tasks as in
product design or financial simulations; where sets of repetitious tasks
are run as in software QA; where large numbers of users are placing jobs
on limited resources as in education environments; and where users are
launching parallel applications across massive numbers of processors for
applications such as weather simulation.
      <p><b>Q: Why is Sun launching the Grid Engine project?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>A: </b>Sun believes the era of distributed, networked computing is
just beginning, and Sun wants to accelerate the adoption of the model by
providing high quality enabling DRM technology, by facilitating the development
of open standards for DRM software, and by enabling solution providers
to address customer needs. As the use of DRM software shifts from the "innovator"
phase to the mainstream, open source provides the proven collaborative
development environment that ensures the widest set of needs are met, and
with high quality code. Open source facilitates the development of open
standards which are important for interoperability with applications and
for ease of integration. Perhaps most importantly the Grid Engine project
effectively provides integrators, support organizations and other service
providers a independent 'business franchise' in the deployment and maintenance
of Grid Engine enabled solutions.
      </p>
      <p><b>Q: What software is included in the Grid Engine project?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>A: </b>The Grid Engine project includes source code files for
Grid Engine software. This contains the following functionality:<br>

      </p>

      
      <ul>

        <li>master daemon, scheduler and shadow master (failover) functionality</li>

        <li>execution daemon functionality for most available Unix flavors</li>

        <li>batch and interactive job support</li>

        <li>parallel make</li>

        <li>administrative, monitoring and submission command line interface clients<br>

        </li>

        <li>GUI</li>

        <li>C language and Java language <a href="http://www.drmaa.org">DRMAA</a> (Distributed Resource Management&nbsp; Application API)&nbsp; binding</li>

        <li>man pages</li>

        <li>support of&nbsp; certificate based security<br>

        </li>

      
      </ul>

      <p><b>Q: How does software from the Grid Engine project differ from N1 Grid Engine software suite distributed by Sun?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>A: </b>The Grid Engine project is an open source project,
and as
such, is focused on development of future versions of Grid Engine
software
through the community process.&nbsp; In addition to the open source
functionality the Sun branded N1 Grid Engine software suite offers:</p>

      
      <ul>

        <li>ARCo - Accounting and Reporting Console, a web based
interface to accounting and monitoring data. The data are accessed from
a SQL database<br>

        </li>

        <li>GEMM - Grid Engine Management Module, a SCS (Sun Control
Station) plugin for automatic deployment and monitoring of a N1 Grid
Engine cluster</li>

        <li>Microsoft Windows support for job execution, job submission and cluster administration</li>

        <li>commercial&nbsp; support&nbsp; contract and services available from Sun</li>

      
      </ul>

The most recent
version of Sun Grid Engine binaries available from Sun may be downloaded
at <a href="http://www.sun.com/gridware/">www.sun.com/gridware</a>
      <p><b>Q: What version of software is Sun making available in the Grid Engine
project ?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>A:</b> The current version is Grid Engine 6.0.<br>


      </p>
      <p><b>Q: How will the Grid Engine project facilitate heterogeneous compute
farms?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>A: </b>Grid Engine software has been ported to many operating systems,
including Sun Solaris, Linux, SGI IRIX, Compaq/HP Tru64, IBM AIX, HP HP/UX, Apple Mac OS/X and others. The project
welcomes those who are interested in implementing new ports or in taking
over the maintenance of an existing port. Interoperability test suites
included in the project will facilitate maintenance and testing of ports.
      </p>
      <p><b>Q: Will the Grid Engine project promote open standards for DRM software?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>A: </b>Developing open standards for DRM is a basic objective of
the project. A lack of a standard API for application programs has discouraged ISVs
from directly interfacing to the DRM software layer, which results in increased
integration tasks. Sun recognizes that the open source movement has facilitated
the development of new open standards. The Grid Engine project is working
towards development of open standards for DRM software, initially for an
API for application programs, through cooperative efforts with ISVs and
other producers of DRM software. See also the 
      <a href="http://www.drmaa.org/">DRMAA Working Group</a> within the Global Grid Forum.&nbsp;<br>


      </p>
      <p><b>Q: Will Sun continue to work on the Grid Engine sources as part of
gridengine.sunsource.net?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>A: </b>Sun's development team in Regensburg, Germany, will continue
their full development efforts through the project. See the <a href="/project/gridengine/governance.html">governance</a>
page for a description of project roles. The project welcomes the involvement
of new users and developers!
      </p>
      <p><b>Q: I found a bug; how do I report it? Where can I ask a question?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>A: </b>Grid Engine is currently using IssueZilla to track bugs. IssueZilla
is an open source bug tracking system developed and used by Mozilla. You
use IssueZilla to browse or modify existing bugs, or enter new bugs. Start

      <h3>
      <font color="#cc3300">License FAQ</font></h3>

      <b>Q: What is the license for the Grid Engine project?</b>
      <p><b>A: </b>The project uses the Sun Industry Standards Source License,
or SISSL. This license is recognized as a free and open license by the
      <a href="http://www.gnu.org/fsf/fsf.html">Free Software Foundation
      </a>and
the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative</a> respectively.
This license is a good license where interoperability and commercial considerations
are important. Under the SISSL license a user may do what they like with
the source base, such as modifing it and extending it, but the user must
maintain compatibility if they want to provide their modified version to
others. It is not mandatory for the user to contribute back code changes
to the project, though of course this is encouraged. If a user wishes to
make available a modified version which is not compatible with the project,
the license requires that the licensee must provide a reference implementation
of sources which constitute the modification, thereby opening the details
of any incompatibility/modification which has been introduced. Additionally
the non-compliant modified version cannot use the Grid Engine name.
      </p>
      <p><b>Q: What are the project standards for?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>A: </b>The project standards are designed to facilitate both compatibility
and evolution of the technology. As the community works to advance Grid
Engine technology, the project standards define a common framework so that
components from different users can interoperate. Additionally, this same
framework defines the boundaries in which individual users can create proprietary
value-added extensions and modifications.
      </p>
      <p>Each release of the software will include a test suite so that users
can validate in a uniform way their modified versions for internal operation
and for interoperability with reference project binaries. These tests will
be specific to a release and will evolve with the technology.
      </p>
      <p>The project standards also specify that the modifications made by users
are limited by component interfaces and protocols. Of course, these interfaces
and protocols are part of the project, and suggestions and contributions
for modifications and enhancements of these interfaces and protocols are
welcomed and encouraged.
      </p>
      <p><b>Q: I want to modify Grid Engine for my own internal use. Do the project
standards pertain to me?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>A: </b>You may make any modification you wish to Grid Engine code
for internal use in your organization. The project standards only apply
to those who are providing Grid Engine binaries and/or source to others
outside their organization.
      </p>
      <p><b>Q: I want to redistribute a modified version, but my modification
requires a change to an internal interface. What do I do?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>A: </b>Offer your modified internal interface as a contribution.
This way the community can benefit from an advance in the internal interfaces,
while you can keep your modifications on the 'user' side of the interface
proprietary if you wish. Of course, the project encourages all contributions!
      </p>
      <p><b>Q: Are there any licensing issues regarding contributing code and other content to
the project?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b><a name="contributoragreement"></a>A: </b>Sun asks that developers grant a license to Sun to use the
contributed code in the Grid Engine project under the SISSL license. This
grant is done by completing a <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/opensource/contributor_agreement.jsp">Contributor

      </p>
      <p><b>Q: Can unmodified Grid Engine binaries be redistibuted commercially?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>A: </b>The SISSL license supports this. Please read and understand
the license when downloading binaries from the <a href="/project/gridengine/download.html">download</a>
page. Remember that software in the project is in development!
      </p>
      <p><b>Q: Can I develop and redistribute proprietary products using Grid

      <h3><font color="#cc3300">Technical FAQ</font></h3>

      <b>Q: Does Grid Engine run on platform xyz?</b>
      <p><b>A: </b>Have a look at our <a href="/project/gridengine/download.html">download
page</a> for a list of platforms to which Grid Engine has been ported and
for a list of platforms where ready-to-use binary distributions are available.
      </p>
      <p><b>Q: What kind of security does Grid Engine use?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>A: </b>Grid Engine can be configured to accept only messages that
are coming from special hosts and reserved port. This mechanism provides
security comparable to that of rsh. For improved security installations
an integration with Kerberos5 and DCE exists. This integration has not
been used frequently and does not come with an out-of-the-box installation
procedure. It still should be possible to get it working with a little
effort if you are particularly concerned about security. In addition, a
SSL based security framework prototype exists which represents an opportunity
for an interesting and relatively small developement project toward a Grid
Engine embedded security solution without a need for Kerberos or DCE.
      </p>
      <p><b>Q: How can I get Grid Engine in some language other than English?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>A: </b>Grid Engine has been internationalized and prepared for localization.
The internationalization is based on gettext. There exist test localizations
that can be used for additional localization efforts. An overview what
has been done and what has to be done can be found in the I18N source description
document. So anyone who is interested in helping with l10n is very welcome
;-)
      </p>
      <p><b>Q: What interfaces does Grid Engine have?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>A: </b>Grid Engine has a command line interface that is aligned with
the POSIX standard for batch queuing systems 1003.2d, Motif based GUI representing
the full Grid Engine client functionality and there is a library interface
(GDI). The GDI (Grid Engine Database Interface) is used by most Grid Engine
clients to implement their functionality. See the 
      <a href="http://gridengine.sunsource.net/unbranded-source/browse/%7Echeckout%7E/gridengine/source/libs/gdi/gdi.html?content-type=text/html">GDI module</a> 
description for more information. Note that this interface is
evolving. One of the objectives of the Grid Engine project is to work with
the community to develop a stable API for integration with applications. 
      </p>
      <p><b>Q: Where can I get the POSIX 1003.2d specification?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>A: </b>You can buy it from IEEE: <a href="http://standards.ieee.org/catalog/posix.html">http://standards.ieee.org/catalog/posix.html.</a>
