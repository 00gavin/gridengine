<b>What is the Grid Engine project?</b><br>
<p>The Grid Engine project is an open source community effort to facilitate 
the adoption of distributed computing solutions. Sponsored by <a href=
"http://www.sun.com/gridware" target="_blank">Sun Microsystems</a> 
and hosted by <a href="http://www.collab.net" target="_blank">CollabNet</a>, 
the Grid Engine project provides enabling distributed resource management software
for wide ranging requirements from compute farms to grid computing.
</p>

<p>
<b>Mission</b><br>

<p>The Grid Engine project is about expanding the application and use of distributed
computing. We want to: 

<ul>
<li>Advance Grid Engine technology
<li>Establish community-driven standards for distributed computing
<li>Enable developers to create innovative services and applications across
distributed heterogeneous compute environments</ul>

<p>
We've outlined an overall vision and set of objectives guiding our 
our development process. You can view them in our 
<a href="background.html">introduction 
page</a> and our <a href="documentation.html">documentation</a>.</p>

<p>
<b>About This Site</b><br>
<p>This site is a base for continued collaborative development of the Grid Engine 
project. You will find Grid Engine distributed resource management software here, 
as well as evolving ideas for continued evolution of the code. We hope you will 
find the Grid Engine project useful in the deployment of your distributed computing 
applications.
