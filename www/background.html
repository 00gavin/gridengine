<br>
To facilitate adoption of the distributed Grid Computing model, Sun Microsystems 
acquired Gridware, a private devloper of Distributed Resource Management (DRM) 
software, in July 2000. With this acquisition Sun was able to eliminate the cost 
barrier of implementing compute farms, the basic building blocks of grid computing, 
by releasing Sun Grid Engine as a free downloadable binary for Solaris and for Linux. 
In the first nine months following the product's introduction Sun had over 9,000 
<a href= "http://www.sun.com/gridware">free downloads</a> of Sun Grid Engine software, 
and interest in the technology grew.
<p></p>
<b><font color="#990000">Grid Engine project objectives</font></b><br>
The Grid Engine open source project further extends Sun's commitment to enabling 
the Grid Computing model. The project has these objectives:</p>
<ol>
<li>Technology evolution and adoption</li><br>
Grid Computing is about making large amounts of compute power available for 
applications and users. Collaborative development of Grid Engine technology 
provides the proper development framework to ensure that Grid Engine technology 
meets the requirements of the largest number of users. And as Bill Joy of Sun 
said, &quot;Innovation happens elsewhere&quot;.  Open source invites participation and ideas, 
and the collaborative nature of open source development is a proven approach to 
building high quality code which addresses user needs.<br><br>

<li>Open standards</li><br>
In the absence of standards, Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) have been 
understandably reluctant to directly interface their applications to DRM software. 
The Grid Engine project will foster the creation of new open standards for DRM, 
focusing initially on a community effort to develop a standard API for application 
integration. ISVs would only have to 'write once' to be able to use any compatible 
DRM system, and integration tasks would be eased for the end user.<br><br>

<li>Market infrastructure</li><br>
A vibrant base of channel participants for service and support can ensure that 
everyone will benefit from the Grid Computing model. Today, many organizations use 
internal staff to deploy and maintain compute farms. As the technology will gain 
acceptance, the need for service providers in the market will increase. Open source 
provides a franchise to all market participants unlike any other business agreement or 
license mechanism. All open source licensees have full and equal participation in the 
project and in the community, and will have all the resources necessary to fully 
utilize Grid Engine in implementing integrated solutions. <br></ol> 
<p>
Whether your requirements range from high-throughput computing to high performance 
computing, the Grid Engine open source project makes available a proven, 
commercial-quality system for distributed resource management. We welcome your 
involvement!
