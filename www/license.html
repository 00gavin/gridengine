The Sun Industry Standards Source License</font></h3>

The source code for Grid Engine has been released to the open source 
community under the
      <a href="/project/gridengine/Gridengine_SISSL_license.html">Sun Industry Standards Source License</a>. This license is
recognized as a free and open license by <a href="http://www.gnu.org/fsf/fsf.html">
The Free Software Foundation</a> and 
      <a href="http://www.opensource.org">The Open Source Initiative (OSI)</a>. 

With this license, developers may modify and distribute 
source code and derived binaries freely. Furthermore, developers can choose 
to keep their modifications confidential or make 
them public. This allows commercial vendors to integrate and extend the technology
covered under the license into their products without the need to disclose their 
proprietary implementations.  
      <p>
The Sun Industry Standards License is further designed to encourage and support 
the development of industry standards through the open community-development 
process. The license has requirements designed to discourage divergence from 
the standard(s) referenced in the license. If developers deviate from the 
standard(s) and desire to license their implementation to others, they may do 
so but they must declare their deviation from the standard(s) through a public 
description and a public reference implementation of those deviations. 
      </p>
      <p>
These license features support the Grid Engine <a href="/project/gridengine/background.html">
project objectives</a> to facilitate a strong base of Grid Engine users and 
independent providers, the development of standard APIs and protocols, 
and the interoperability of Grid Engine implementations from all participants in the 
project. 
      </p>
      <p></p>
