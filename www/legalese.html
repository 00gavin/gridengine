<p><b>RESPECT FOR COPYRIGHT OWNERSHIP AND LAW</b></p>

<p>On-line resource-sharing technologies have created opportunities to directly 
and more easily communicate data to others.  Although Sun cannot universally prevent, 
control, monitor or record the sharing activities of peers and groups created by 
others using the Grid Engine technology, Sun strongly adheres to an overriding principle 
requiring the highest level of respect for the rights and property of copyright owners, 
including Sun, as paramount to the passion to collaborate and develop new technologies.  
All users and participants in this Grid Engine project are reminded to comply with 
applicable law and regulation, the Grid Engine license, Terms of Use, and these Guiding 
Principles concerning any use of copyrighted materials.  In this regard, Sun maintains 
that development which makes it easier to create new products and services
can be provided without infringing the intellectual property rights of others.</p>

<p><b><a name="privacy">PRIVACY POLICY</a></b></p>
    
<p>We at Collab.Net, Inc. (&quot;Collab.Net&quot;) and gridengine.sunsource.net, are committed to respecting your privacy and recognize your need for
appropriate protection and 
management of personally identifiable information you share with us (any information by which you can be identified, such as name, address, and 
telephone number). That is why Collab.Net and gridengine.sunsource.net have established this privacy policy, so that you can understand the care with which
we intend 
to treat your information.</p>

<p>In general, you can visit this Website or other Collab.Net Websites without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about 
yourself. We track the Internet address of the domains from which people visit us and analyze this data for trends and statistics, but the individual 
user remains anonymous.</p>

<p>Some of our Web pages utilize &quot;cookies&quot; so that we can better serve you with more tailored information when you return to our site. Cookies are 
identifiers which a Web site can send to your browser to keep on your computer to facilitate your next visit to our site. You can set your browser 
to notify you when you are sent a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. The information we collect and analyze is 
used to improve our service to you.</p>

<p>To protect your privacy, we have adopted the following principles:</p>

<p>INFORMATION</p>

<p>We want to give you information about our privacy policy and assure you that we take reasonable steps to see that it is followed within our company.</p>

<p>CHOICE</p>

<p>There are times when we may collect personal information from you. It is our intent to inform you before we do that and to tell you what we intend 
to do with the information. You will have the option not to provide the information, and in the future you will be able to &quot;opt out&quot; of certain
uses 
of the information. If you choose not to provide the information we request, you can still visit most of this Web site, but you may be unable 
to access certain options, offers, and services. </p>

<p>ACCURACY</p>

<p>We do our best to maintain the accuracy of personal information you supply to us; we are working on tools that will allow you to review and update 
your information in the future. </p>                          

<p>SECURITY</p>

<p>We will take appropriate steps to protect the information you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure. </p>

<p>COMMITMENT</p>

<p>We are committed to privacy and support current industry initiatives to preserve individual privacy rights on the Internet. Personal data privacy is a
new 
and evolving area, and Collab.Net and gridengine.sunsource.net are evolving to meet these demands. Mistakes are possible; miscommunication is possible. If
you have 
any comments or questions regarding our privacy policy, please contact us at <a
