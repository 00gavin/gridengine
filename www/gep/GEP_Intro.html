    The Grid Engine Portal (GEP, formerly known as Sun Technical Computing
 Portal  - TCP) project provides a Java based capability for enabling highly
 secure  internet access to applications that run on an existing Grid Engine
  grid.<br>
    <br>
     Users authenticate to a portal interface from anywhere on the internet 
 via a browser and can then:     
<ul>
       <li>Securely access and execute applications via a transparent interface
  to Grid Engine</li>
       <li>Monitor the status of jobs running in Grid Engine</li>
       <li>Securely upload input files to the Portal Server with the click
 of  a button</li>
       <li>Securely download output files to a local workstation with the 
click  of a button</li>
       <li>View X-windows based applications using VNC</li>
         
</ul>
     Administrators can also remotely access the portal and perform administrative
  functions such as:     
<ul>
       <li>Registering applications for use with the GEP in a matter of minutes</li>
       <li>Quickly building HTML interfaces to applications using templates 
 that prompt users for input</li>
       <li>Monitoring Grid Engine usage and statistics</li>
         
</ul>
     In most cases this can be done without any modification of the existing
  application !<br>
     Furthermore, since applications can be executable scripts (and HTML
interfaces   can be easily built for scripts)  this provides an efficient
mechanism for   handling complex job streams.<br>
     <br>
     Since the variety of uses for such a capability are numerous, GEP offers
  some basic features that many user  communities have found beneficial.
The   source code was designed with the idea of making it available to the
user   community for further enhancements  and capabilities. The Grid Engine
Portal   currently relies on GE as well as the SunONE Portal Server for its
functionality   although both are loosely coupled within the Grid Engine
Portal source code.   <br>

<p>     Commercial packages such as Tarantella are also available for displaying
  graphics and interactive applications from  multiple platforms (Java, Microsoft,
  and X-windows) in a browser window. These packages offer much higher performance
   than VNC and are independently integrated with the Sun ONE Portal Server
  3.0. <br>
     A demo of this package as well as software downloads and instructions
 are  available directly from <a href="http://www.tarantella.com">http://www.tarantella.com</a>. 
  (A Portal Server 6 integration will be available shortly.)   </p>
   
<h2><a name="Grid_Engine_Portal_Components_and"></a>Grid Engine Portal Components
and Installation Overview</h2>
     First of all the Grid Engine Portal installation requires that an existing
  (S)GE (version 5.3p2 or later) or (S)GEEE i grid has been set up. For details
  on setting up (S)GE(EE) go to the web site  <a
 href="http://wwws.sun.com/software/grid/">http://wwws.sun.com/software/grid/</a>. 
  It is recommended that those unfamiliar with grid technology begin by taking
  the online Sun ONE Grid Technology Overview class.  Administrators may
also   wish to take the <a
 href="http://wwws.sun.com/software/gridware/training.html">Sun ONE Grid
Engine web-based Training</a>.<br>
     <br>
     The next step is the installation of Sun ONE Portal Server (version
6  or  later). <br>
     <small><small>Note: there is also a Grid Engine Portal version available
  for version 3.0SP2 (or later) although  it is recommended that users who
 do not have an existing Portal installation begin with version 6.</small></small><br>
     A trial/development package is included with the Solaris 9 disks. Alternatively
  you can download a development version  <a
 href="http://wwws.sun.com/software/product_categories/portal_servers.html">here</a>.<br>
     Sites that require remote visualization capabilities should download 
and  install the Secure Remote Access package  as part of this installation.
  For detailed installation instructions consult the <a
 href="http://gridengine.sunsource.net">Grid Engine Portal Installation Guide</a>. 
  This guide should be read before beginning to install the Portal Server.<br>
     <br>
     Get the Grid Engine Portal package available <a
 href="http://gridengine.sunsource.net">here</a>. <br>
     The final step is to customize the portal, install your applications,
 and  build simple html interfaces based on the provided templates.<br>

     <font color="#ff0000">&lt;Andre to provide directions for downloading
 the  GEP package.&gt;</font><br>
     Do we setup a special GEP mailing list ?<br>
     OSC enhancement requests ?<br>
     Thumbnails of GEP screenshots should probably go here or even better 
a  link  to a life demo installation <br>
     Renaming of servlets how ? Shall we keep SunTCP, AdminTCP ?<br>
     Full role support -&gt; changes in install guide.<br>
     Issuezilla category GEP should be installed!</font><br>
