      The Grid Engine Portal (GEP, formerly known as Sun Technical Computing
  Portal  - TCP) project provides a Java based capability for enabling highly
  secure  internet access to applications that run on an existing Grid Engine
   grid.<br>
      <br>
       Users authenticate to a portal interface from anywhere on the internet 
  via a browser and can then:       
<ul>
         <li>Securely access and execute applications via a transparent interface
   to Grid Engine</li>
         <li>Monitor the status of jobs running in Grid Engine</li>
         <li>Securely upload input files to the Portal Server with the click
  of  a button</li>
         <li>Securely download output files to a local workstation with the 
 click  of a button</li>
         <li>View X-windows based applications using VNC</li>
             
</ul>
       Administrators can also remotely access the portal and perform administrative
   functions such as:       
<ul>
         <li>Registering applications for use with the GEP in a matter of 
minutes</li>
         <li>Quickly building HTML interfaces to applications using templates 
  that prompt users for input</li>
         <li>Monitoring Grid Engine usage and statistics</li>
             
</ul>
       In most cases this can be done without any modification of the existing
   application !<br>
       Furthermore, since applications can be executable scripts (and HTML
 interfaces   can be easily built for scripts)  this provides an efficient
 mechanism for   handling complex job streams.<br>
       <br>
       Since the variety of uses for such a capability are numerous, GEP
offers    some basic features that many user  communities have found beneficial.
The   source code was designed with the idea of making it available to the
user   community for further enhancements  and capabilities. <br>
<br>
<b>The Grid Engine Portal   currently relies on GE as well as the SunONE
Portal Server for its functionality   although both are loosely coupled within
the Grid Engine Portal source code.   </b><br>
       <br>
  <br>
   
<h2>Grid Engine Portal Components and Installation Overview</h2>
  The Grid Engine Portal comprises three components:<br>
   
<ul>
    <li>Grid Engine</li>
    <li>SunONE Portal Server</li>
    <li>Grid Engine Portal servlets<br>
    </li>
   
</ul>
  To enable window based applications through the portal the additional installation
 of VNC or Tarantella can be added.<br>
  <br>
   
<ol>
    <li>Grid Engine<br>
      <br>
  The Grid Engine Portal installation requires that an existing   (S)GE (version
 5.3p2 or later) or (S)GEEE&nbsp; grid has been set up. Details   on setting
 up (S)GE(EE) can be found on the websites mentioned in the table below.<br>
     It is recommended that those unfamiliar with grid technology begin by
 taking   the online Sun ONE Grid Technology Overview class.  Administrators
 may also   wish to take the SunONE Grid Engine web-based training.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>SunONE Portal Server<br>
      <br>
  The next step is the installation of SunONE Portal Server (version 6  or
  later). <small><small><br>
      <br>
  Note: there is also a Grid Engine Portal version available   for version
 iPlanet Portal Server 3.0SP2 (or later) although  it is recommended that
users who  do not have an existing Portal installation begin with version
6.</small></small><br>
      <br>
  A trial/development package is included with the Solaris 9 disks. &nbsp;It
 can also be downloaded form the link mentioned in the table below. Sites
that require remote visualization capabilities should download and  install
the Secure Remote Access package  as part of this installation for Netlet
support. For detailed installation instructions consult the <a
 href="http://gridengine.sunsource.net/gep/GEP_InstallGuide.html">Grid Engine
Portal Installation Guide</a>.    This guide should be read before beginning&nbsp;
in the Portal Server installation.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>Grid Engine Portal servlets<br>
      <br>
  After fetching and unpacking the Grid Engine Portal server package the
included  install script has to be executed. This is outlined in detail in
the Grid  Engine Portal Installation Guide. The package for either iPS 3.0
or S1PS 6.0 can be found in the table below.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>VNC<br>
      <br>
  Optionally VNC can be installed to enable portal access of graphical applications.
 See the links below.<br>
    </li>
   
</ol>
  <br>
  The final step is to customize the portal, install your applications, 
and   build simple html interfaces based on the provided templates.<br>
  <br>
