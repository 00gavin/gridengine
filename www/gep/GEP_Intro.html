<h1>Welcome to the Grid Engine Portal Home Page</h1>
The Grid Engine Portal project provides a java based capability for&nbsp;
enabling secure internet access to applications that run on an existing SGE
grid. <br>
Users authenticate to a portal interface from anywhere on the internet and
can then securely:
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp; Execute applications via a transparent interface to Grid
Engine</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp; Monitor the status of jobs running in Grid Engine</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp; Upload input files to the Portal Server with the click
of a button</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp; Download output files to a local workstation with the
click of a button</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp; View X-windows based applications using VNC</li>
</ul>
Administrators can also remotely access the portal and perform administrative
functions like
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp; Registering applications for use with the GP in a matter
of minutes</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp; Quickly building HTML interfaces to applications using
templates</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp; Monitoring usage and statistics</li>
</ul>
In most cases this can be done without any modification of the existing application
! <br>
Furthermore, since applications can be executable scripts (and HTML interfaces
can be easily built for scripts) this provides an efficient mechanism for
handling complex job streams.<br>
<br>
Since the variety of uses for such a capability are numerous, this package
offers some basic features that many user communities should find beneficial.
The source code was designed with the idea of making it available to the
user community for further enhancements and capabilities. The Grid Engine
Portal currently relies on GE as well as the SunONE Portal Server for its
functionality although both are loosely coupled within the Grid Engine Portal
source code. <br>
<br>
The Grid Engine Portal (GEP) package can be downloaded as part of the <a
 href="http://gridengine.sunsource.net">Grid Engine Open Source Project</a>.<br>
<br>

Portal, and to obtain an installation overview <font color="#ff0000">click

Click the following link to download the <a

Portal Server</a>. <br>
<br>
Commercial packages such as Tarantella are also available for displaying
graphics and&nbsp; interactive applications from multiple platforms (Java,
Microsoft, and X-windows) in a browser window. These packages offer much
higher performance than VNC&nbsp; and are independently integrated with the
Sun ONE Portal Server 3.0. <br>
A demo of this package as well as software downloads and instructions are
available directly from <a href="www.tarantella.com">www.tarantella.com</a>.&nbsp;
(A Portal Server 6 integration should be available shortly.)
<h2>Grid Engine Portal&nbsp;Components and Installation Overview</h2>
First of all the Grid Engine Portal installation requires that an existing
SGE (version 5.3p2 or later) or SGEEE grid has been set up. For details on
setting up SGE go to the web site<font color="#ff0000"> <a
 href="http://wwws.sun.com/software/grid/">http://wwws.sun.com/software/grid/</a></font>.
It is recommended that those unfamiliar with grid technology begin by taking
the online Sun ONE Grid Technology Overview class. Administrators may also
wish to take the <font color="#000000">online Sun ONE Grid Engine web-based
Training. </font><br>
Both of these courses are available at <font color="#ff0000"><a
 href="http://wwws.sun.com/software/gridware/training.html">http://wwws.sun.com/software/gridware/training.html</a></font>.<br>
<br>
The next step is the installation of Sun ONE Portal Server (version 6 or
later). <br>
<small><small>Note: there is also a Grid Engine Portal version available
for version 3.0SP2 (or later) although it is recommended that users who do
not have an existing Portal installation begin with version 6. </small></small><br>
A trial/development package is included with the Solaris 9 disks. Alternatively
you can download a development version <font color="#ff0000"><a
 href="http://wwws.sun.com/software/product_categories/portal_servers.html">here</a></font>
.<br>
Sites that require remote visualization capabilities should download and
install the Secure Remote Access package as part of this installation. Some
installation guidelines are included in the complete <font
 color="#ff0000">Grid Engine Portal installation guide&lt;link here&gt;.</font>
This guide should be read before beginning to install the Portal Server.<br>
<br>
Third the Grid Engine Portal software is available from the SGE open source
site. <br>
<font color="#ff0000">&lt;Andre to provide directions for downloading the
GEP package.&gt;</font><br>
<br>
The final step is to customize the portal, install your applications, and
build simple html interfaces based on the provided templates.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<font color="#ff0000">What else todo...<br>
<br>
Do we setup a special GEP mailing list ?<br>
OSC enhancement requests ?<br>
Thumbnails of GEP screenshots should probably go here or even better a link
to a life demo installation <br>
Renaming of servlets how ? Shall we keep SunTCP, AdminTCP ?<br>
Full role support -&gt; changes in install guide.<br>
Issuezilla category GEP should be installed!</font><br>
