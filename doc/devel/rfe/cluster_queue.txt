HOMOGENEOUS HOST CHARACTERISTIC CATEGORIES
==========================================
- reduce the overall amount of queues in homogenious environments

Cluster Queue (CQ)
==================
 
- CQs replace the GE/GEEE-queues
- CQs are assigned to at least one host
- Each CQ has one or more Queue Incarnations (QI)
- A CQ has a maximum of one QI per host
- A CQ assigned to one host corresponds one QI
- All QIs of a CQ have the same configurable attributes (slots, seq_no, ...)
 
Possible Syntax
===============
 
QueueList := QueueName [{[","] QueueName}].
 
ClusterQueueList := CQN [{[","] CQN }].
 
QueueName := CQN | QIN.
 
CQN := CQName.
 
QIN := (CQName "@" Hostname) |
       (CQName "@"  Hostname [{":" Hostname}] ).
 
CQName := <<<Syntax_for_queues_as_before>>>
 
Hostname := <<<Short_or_long_hostname>>>
 
Examples for QueueList:
 
   big
   big@lis
   big@lis:balrog,small@aragorn
   big@lis:balrog:fangorn small
 
Changes in the current behaviour
================================
 
Subordinate list of a CQ:
- Only CQNs are allowed for the "subordinale_list"-Attribute of a CQ
- A relationship between two CQs does not cause limitations in respect of
  host sets of both CQs (overlapping)
- Add/Modify requests which do not fulfil the conditions above will
  result in a corresponding error message.
 
Queue references used in PEs and CKPTs:
- CQNs and QINs are both allowed in the "queue_list" field
 
Properties of CQs:
- For qstat, qmon and other client commands it is necessary to
  hold a table in qmaster which is used to identify how many
  QIs are in a certain state.
 
GDI:
- One CULL-Queue-Object represents a CQ
- The hostname-field will be converted into a list of hostnames
  (hostname groups?). 
- The keyword "all" should be allowed.
- A sublist will be added to the Queue-Object which holds QIs
  information.
- Each QI object containes the hostname and a set of attributes necessary to
  administer QIs
- For client applications it is only possible to address CQs (not CIs)
- The GDI subcommand can be used to modify object entries of a sublist    

Client modification
===================
- qconf commands using queuenames will await CQNs
- Output commands for queues show CQ information and not QI data
- All client commands (except qconf) which expect queuenames as parameter
  have to handle "QueueList"s
- Qutput of client commands (except qconf) will be as before.
  QI information will be displayed.
- Even if a CQ has only one QI the whole QIN including the hostname will
  be printed.
 
qconf
-----
 
aq- mq- dq- option
mattr- dattr- rattr- aattr-Optionen fuer die queue:
- Modifications apply to all QIs of a QC
- "hostname" may be a list of hostnames
 
sq-option;
- shows a CQ with all attributs
 
sql-Option:
- shows a list of all existing CQs
 
cq-option:
- CQNs or CINs
 
NEW-option (-scql [ClusterQueueList]):
- show a list of all existing QIs
- if user specified "ClusterQueueList" then only those QIs will be
  displayed

qstat
-----

without Options
- Shows QIN in the "queue" column

f-Option
- list of all QIs
- "queuename" shows QIN

q-Option
- Shows QINS in the output even if CQNs are used as Parameter

NEW-Option (-g c)
- Summary for all CQs
- If -q Option containes QIs then a summary of concerned
  CQ will be shown
- Output format simmilar to the f-Option but
   * "queuename":   CQN
   * "used/tot.":   Sum of all slots for the CQ
   * "arch":        -
   * "load_avg":    -
   * "states":      -
- Information about individual jobs won't we shown in the output
  
 
qsub, qalter, qsh, qrsh, qacct, qlogin
--------------------------------------
 
q-Option bzw. -masterq:
- list of "QueueNamen"
 
l-Option:
- List of CQNs
 
qmod
- List of "QueueNamen"
 
qhost
-----
 
q-Option:
- analog zu qstat -f
 
j-Option:
- see qstat without Parameter 

qselect
-------
 
q-Option:
- List of "QueueNamen"
- List of QINs
 
QMon
====

- Make CQs configurable 

  Ensure add/modify/copy/delete configuration operations
  on CQs can be performed using Qmon.

- Display summarized CQ state in Qmon

  Display summarized CQ state in Queue control dialogue.
  The information shown here should be the same
  as with "qstat -g c"

- Display detailed QI state in Qmon

  Display per host detailed CQ state. The information
  shown here should be the same as in the old
  Queue control dialogue.

- Make qmod functionality in Qmon working with QIs and CQs
 
Future enhancements
===================
 
- Hostgroups on all places where hostnames are allowed
- Pattern matching for queuenames
- Different attributes for singe QIs
 
Additional Questions
====================
 
Which documentation changes are necessary?
Which changes are necessary for the installation procedures?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HETEROGENEOUS HOST CHARACTERISTIC CATEGORIES
============================================
- reduce the overall amount of queues in heterogenious environments

Changes in the current behaviour
================================
GDI:
- For client applications it has to be possible to address CIs:
  It should be possible to address at least following attributes
  in an CI: 
      seq_no
      priority
      owner_list
      user_lists
      xuser_lists

Client modifications
====================

qconf
-----
NEW-Option (-mqi QIN)
- Modify a QI
      
Additional Questions
====================
Which other attributes should be modifiable within QIs?
