.SH DESCRIPTION
The drmaa_job_ps() function returns the status of the xxQS_NAMExx job \fIjob_id\fP 
into the integer pointed to by \fIremote_ps\fP. Possible return values are 
.sp 1
.RS
.nf
DRMAA_PS_UNDETERMINED        job status cannot be determined
DRMAA_PS_QUEUED_ACTIVE       job is queued and active
DRMAA_PS_SYSTEM_ON_HOLD      job is queued and in system hold
DRMAA_PS_USER_ON_HOLD        job is queued and in user hold
DRMAA_PS_USER_SYSTEM_ON_HOLD job is queued and in user and system hold
DRMAA_PS_RUNNING             job is running
DRMAA_PS_SYSTEM_SUSPENDED    job is system suspended
DRMAA_PS_USER_SUSPENDED      job is user suspended
DRMAA_PS_DONE                job finished normally
DRMAA_PS_FAILED              job finished, but failed

.sp 1
Jobs user hold and user suspend state can be controled via 
.M drmaa_control 3 .
For affecting system hold and system suspend states the appropriate
xxQS_NAMExx interfaces must be used.
.\" 
.\" 
.\" 
.SS "drmaa_control()"
The drmaa_control() function applies control operations on xxQS_NAMExx jobs. Either a
xxQS_NAMExx jobid can be passed to \fIjobid\fP or `DRMAA_JOB_IDS_SESSION_ALL' to refer
to all jobs submitted during the DRMAA session opend using
.M drmaa_init 3 .
Legal values for \fIaction\fP and their meanings are: 
.sp 1
.RS
.nf
DRMAA_CONTROL_SUSPEND        suspend the job 
DRMAA_CONTROL_RESUME         resume the job,
DRMAA_CONTROL_HOLD           put the job on-hold 
DRMAA_CONTROL_RELEASE        release the hold on the job
DRMAA_CONTROL_TERMINATE      kill the job
.fi
.RE
.sp 1
The DRMAA suspend/resume operations are equivalent to the use of 
`-s <jobid>' and `-us <jobid>' options with  
xxQS_NAMExx
.M qmod 1 .
The DRMAA hold/release operations are equivalent to the use of 
xxQS_NAMExx
.M qhold 1 
and 
.M qrls 1 .
The DRMAA terminate operation is equivalent to the use of 
xxQS_NAMExx
.M qdel 1 .
Only user hold and user suspend can be controled via 
.M drmaa_control 3 . 
For affecting system hold and system suspend states the appropriate
xxQS_NAMExx interfaces must be used.

.SH "RETURN VALUES"
Upon successful completion, drmaa_job_ps(), and drmaa_control() return 
DRMAA_ERRNO_SUCCESS. Other values indicate an error. Up to \fIerror_diag_len\fP characters of error related diagnosis 
information is then provided in the buffer \fIerror_diagnosis\fP.
