.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Qmod
enables users classified as \fIowners\fP (see
.M queue_conf 5
for details) of a workstation to modify
the state of xxQS_NAMExx queues for his/her machine as well
as the state of his/her own jobs.
A manager/operator or root can execute
.I qmod
for any queue and job in a cluster.
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.\"
.IP "\fB\-c\fP"
Clears the error state of the specified queue(s).
.IP "\fB\-d\fP"
Disables the queue(s), i.e. no further jobs are dispatched to
disabled queues while jobs already executing in these queues
are allowed to finish.
.sp 1
(Is the successor of the CODINE version 3 -soc option.)
.IP "\fB\-e\fP"
Enables the queue(s).
.sp 1
(Is the successor of the CODINE version 3 -xsoc option.)
.IP "\fB\-f\fP"
Force the modification action for the queue despite the
apparent current state of the queue. For example if a queue
appears to be suspended but the job execution seems to be
continuing the manager/operator can force a suspend operation which
will send a SIGSTOP to the jobs. In any case, the queue or
job status will be set even if the
.M xxqs_name_sxx_execd 8
controlling the queues/jobs cannot be reached. Requires
manager/operator privileges.
.\"
.IP "\fB\-help\fP"
Prints a listing of all options.
.IP "\fB\-r\fP"
If applied to queues,
reschedules all jobs currently running in this queue.
If applied to running jobs, reschedules the jobs.
.\"
.IP "\fB\-s\fP"
If applied to queues,
suspends the queues and any jobs which might
be active. If applied to running jobs, suspends the jobs. If a job is
both suspended explicitly and via suspension of its queue, a
following unsuspend of the queue will not release the suspension
state on the job.
.\"
.IP "\fB\-us\fP"
If applied to queues,
unsuspends the queues and any jobs which might
be active. If applied to jobs, unsuspends the jobs. If a job is
both suspended explicitly and via suspension of its queue, a
following unsuspend of the queue will not release the suspension
state on the job.
.\"
.IP "\fB\-verify\fP"
performs no modifications but just prints what would be done if
\fB\-verify\fB was not present.
.\"
.IP "\fBjob/task_id_list | queue_list\fP"
The jobs or queues upon which
.I qmod
is supposed to operate. The \fBjob/task_id_list\fP is
specified by one of the following forms:
.sp 1
.ta 0.5i
    \fIjob_id[.task_range][,job_id[.task_range],...]\fP
.br
    \fIjob_id[.task_range][ job_id[.task_range] ...]\fP
.ta 0.0i
.sp 1
If present, the \fItask_range\fP restricts the effect of the \fIqmod\fP
operation to the array job task range specified as suffix to the job id
(see the \fB\-t\fP option to
.M qsub 1
for further details on array jobs).
.sp 1
The task range specifier has the
form n[-m[:s]][,n[-m[:s]], ...] or n[-m[:s]][ n[-m[:s]] ...] and thus
consists of a comma or blank separated
list of range specifiers n[-m[:s]]. The ranges are concatenated to the
complete task id range. Each range may be a single number, a simple
range of the form n-m or a range with a step size.
.sp 1
The \fIqueue_list\fP is specified by one of the following forms:
.sp 1
.ta 0.5i
    \fIqueuename[,queuename ...]\fP
.br
    \fIqueuename[ queuename ...]\fP
.ta 0.0i
.sp 1
Alternatively a wildcard charcter "*" can be used for specifying
queues,  e.g. "s*" will select all queues starting with "s".

.SH "ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES"
.\" 
.IP "\fBxxQS_NAME_Sxx_ROOT\fP" 1.5i
Specifies the location of the xxQS_NAMExx standard configuration
files.
.\"
.IP "\fBxxQS_NAME_Sxx_CELL\fP" 1.5i
If set, specifies the default xxQS_NAMExx cell. To address a xxQS_NAMExx
cell
.I qmod
uses (in the order of precedence):
.sp 1
.RS
.RS
The name of the cell specified in the environment 
variable xxQS_NAME_Sxx_CELL, if it is set.
.sp 1
The name of the default cell, i.e. \fBdefault\fP.
.sp 1
.RE
.RE
.\"
.IP "\fBxxQS_NAME_Sxx_DEBUG_LEVEL\fP" 1.5i
If set, specifies that debug information
should be written to stderr. In addition the level of
detail in which debug information is generated is defined.
.\"
.IP "\fBCOMMD_PORT\fP" 1.5i
If set, specifies the tcp port on which
.M xxqs_name_sxx_commd 8
is expected to listen for communication requests.
Most installations will use a services map entry instead
to define that port.
.\"
.IP "\fBCOMMD_HOST\fP" 1.5i
If set, specifies the host on which the particular
.M xxqs_name_sxx_commd 8
to be used for xxQS_NAMExx communication of the
.I qmod
client resides.
Per default the local host is used.
