.SH NAME
access_list \- xxQS_NAMExx access list file format
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
Access lists are used in xxQS_NAMExx to define access permissions of users
to queues (see
.M queue_conf 5 )
or parallel environments (see
.M xxqs_name_sxx_pe 5 ).
A list of currently configured access lists can be displayed via the
.M qconf 1
\fB\-sul\fP option. The contents of each enlisted access list can
shown via the \fB\-su\fP switch. The output follows the
.I access_list
format description. New access lists can be created and existing can be
modified via the \fB\-au\fP and \fB\-du\fP options to
.M qconf 1 .
.\"
.\"
.SH FORMAT
Each user or UNIX user group appears in a single lines. Only symbolic names
are allowed. A group is differentiated from a user name by prefixing the
group name with a '@' sign.
