.TH HOSTGROUP 5 "$Date: 2001/07/18 11:04:50 $"

.SH NAME
hostgroup \- host group entry file format
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
A host group entry is used to merge host names to groups. Each
host group entry file defines one group. A group is referenced by
the sign "@" as first character of the name. At this point
of implementation you can use host groups in the 
.M usermapping 5
configuration. Inside a group definition file you can also reference
to groups. This groups are called subgroups.  

.PP
Each line in the host group entry file specifies a host name or a
group which belongs to this group.

.PP
A list of currently configured host group entries can be displayed 
via the
.M qconf 1
\fB\-shgrpl\fP option. The contents of each enlisted host group entry 
can be
shown via the \fB\-shgrp\fP switch. The output follows the
.I hostgroup
format description. New host group entries can be created and existing can be
modified via the \fB\-ahgrp\fP, \fB\-mhgrp\fP and \fB\-dhgrp\fP options to
.M qconf 1 .
.\"
.\"
.SH FORMAT
A host group entry contains at least two parameters:
.IP "\fBgroup_name keyword\fP"
The group_name keyword defines the host group name. The rest of
the textline after the keyword "group_name" will be taken as host group
name value.

.IP "\fBhostname\fP"
The name of the host which is now member of the group specified with 
\fBgroup_name\fP.  
If The first character of the hostname is a "@" sign the name is used to 
reference a 
.M hostgroup 5 
which is taken as sub group of this group.

.\"

.SH EXAMPLE
This is a typical host group entry:

.PP
group_name bigMachines
.PP
@calculate
.PP
speedhost
.PP

The entry will define a new host group called 
\fBbigMachines\fP. In this host group is the host 
\fBspeedhost\fP and all members of the host group 
\fBcalculate\fP.
