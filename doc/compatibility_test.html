<h1>
<b><font size=+4>Standard Compatibility Test</font></b></h1>

<p><br>Compatibility is an important aspect of the <a href="gridengine/www/Gridengine_SISSL_license.html">License</a>
under which Grid Engine source code is made available. In this context,
cross compatibility may have to be certified between a version of the Grid
Engine software which you have enhanced and a version declared as one of
Grid Engine's <font color="#990000">Standard Versions</font> from which
your modification deviates. Note, that over time there can be multiple
Standard Versions representing different stable software release levels.
You might intend to test compatibility with one or with multiple of those
Standard Versions. A list of the currently available Standard Versions
with all pertinent information can be found <a href="standard_version.html">here</a>.
<p>The following describes how to test compatibility between two versions.
You will need to create a <a href="gridengine/source/dist/dist.html">binary
distribution package</a>&nbsp; for both versions before you start with
the compatibility checking process. You will also have to make all preparations
to be able to run the Grid Engine <a href="/home/ff114084/CODINE/OS/gridengine/testsuite/testsuite.html">Testsuite</a>.
You will have to use the Testsuite level as defined in the <a href="standard_versions.html">Standard
Version definition</a>.
<p>The compatibility test consist of a preparation step, a validation run
of the Standard Version and multiple compatibility checks. Your changed
version has to pass all tests without error and has to deliver the same
results as the validation run to be considered compatible.

<h1>
<font size=+2>Preparation:</font></h1>

<ul>
<li>
<font size=+2>Set up a testsuite cluster with more than one host</font></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>The <a href="/cod_home/cr114091/CollabNet_OpenSource/gridengine/testsuite/testsuite.html">Testsuite</a>
documentation is describing how this can be done. Use the <b><i>Standard
Version</i></b> to which you want to test compatibility and run:</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<blockquote><tt>expect check.exp install</tt></blockquote>
<tt>You will be asked on which hosts you want to install a testsuite cluster
and you will have to use at least 2 for the purpose of the compatibility
test.</tt></blockquote>

<h1>
<font size=+2>Validation:</font></h1>

<ul>
<li>
<font size=+2>Run testsuite on Standard Version</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p>Run the testsuite with runlevel&nbsp; 1:
<br>&nbsp;
<ul><tt>expect check.exp all 1</tt></ul>

<p><br><tt>Do not remove the test results of the validation run. Every
testsuite run will manipulate the results directory, so copy your validation
results before running another test. You will need to compare your validation
run results with the subsequent compatibility runs. No errors must occur
during the validation run. If you encounter errors then this might be due
to network setup problems in your cluster or similar issues. Fix those
first before you proceed. Report your problem if it persits. You cannot
test compatibility with a validation run with errors.</tt></ul>

<h1>
<font size=+2>Check 1: Qmaster compatibility</font></h1>

<ul><tt>(If you are absolutely sure that your modification did not change
sge_qmaster you may skip this step, but be aware that changes in some libraries,
like for instance the scheduler library, may also modify sge_qmaster. Carry
out the test if you are not 100% sure.)</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font size=+2>Shutdown the system</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p>Use the testsuite to shutdown the cluster:
<br>&nbsp;
<ul><tt>expect check.exp kill</tt></ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font size=+2>Exchange the sge_qmaster binary with the one from your modified
version</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font size=+2>Run the testsuite</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p>Run the testsuite again:
<br>&nbsp;
<ul><tt>expect check.exp all 1</tt></ul>

<li>
<font size=+2>Compare results with validation run</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Stop if the results are not equal.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font size=+2>Shutdown the system</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p>Use the testsuite to shutdown the cluster:
<br>&nbsp;
<ul><tt>expect check.exp kill</tt></ul>

<li>
<font size=+2>Re-Exchange the sge_qmaster binary with the one from the
Standard Version</font></li>
</ul>
