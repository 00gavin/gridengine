<b><font size="+2" class="PageHeader">Standard Compatibility Test</font></b></H3>
<br><br>
<p>Compatibility is an important aspect of the <a href="/project/gridengine/license.html">License</a>
under which Grid Engine source code is made available. In this context,
cross compatibility may have to be certified between a version of the Grid
Engine software which you have enhanced and a version declared as one of
Grid Engine's <font color="#990000">Reference Builds</font> from which
your modification deviates. Note, that over time there can be multiple
Reference Builds representing different stable software release levels.
You might intend to test compatibility with one or with multiple of those
Reference Builds. A list of the currently available Reference Builds with
all pertinent information can be found <a href="/project/gridengine/standards.html">here</a>.
<p>The following describes how to test compatibility between two bilds.
You will need to create a <a href="../source/dist/dist.html">binary distribution
package</a>&nbsp; for both builds before you start with the compatibility
checking process. You will also have to make all preparations to be able
to run the Grid Engine <a href="../testsuite/testsuite.html">Testsuite</a>.
You will have to use the Testsuite level as defined in the <a href="/project/gridengine/standards.html">Reference
Build definition</a>.
<p>The compatibility test consist of a preparation step, a validation run
of the Standard Version and multiple compatibility checks. Your changed
version has to pass all tests without error and has to deliver the same
results as the validation run to be considered compatible.

<font class="ParagraphHeader">Preparation:</font></H3>

<ul>
<li>
<font class="ParagraphHeader">Set up a testsuite cluster with more than one host</font></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>The <a href="../testsuite/testsuite.html">Testsuite</a> documentation
is describing how this can be done. Use the <b><i>Reference Build</i></b>
to which you want to test compatibility and run:</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<blockquote><tt>expect check.exp install</tt></blockquote>
<tt>You will be asked on which hosts you want to install a testsuite cluster
and you will have to use at least 2 for the purpose of the compatibility
test.</tt></blockquote>

<H3>
<font class="ParagraphHeader">Validation:</font></H3>

<ul>
<li>
<font class="ParagraphHeader">Run testsuite on Reference Build</font></li>

<p><br>Run the testsuite with runlevel&nbsp; 1:
<br>&nbsp;
<ul><tt>expect check.exp all 1</tt></ul>

<p><br><tt>Do not remove the test results of the validation run. Every
testsuite run will manipulate the results directory, so copy your validation
results before running another test. You will need to compare your validation
run results with the subsequent compatibility runs. No errors must occur
during the validation run. If you encounter errors then this might be due
to network setup problems in your cluster or similar issues. Fix those
first before you proceed. Report your problem if it persits. You cannot
test compatibility with a validation run with errors.</tt></ul>

<H3>
<font class="ParagraphHeader">Check 1: Qmaster compatibility</font></H3>

<ul><tt>(If you are absolutely sure that your modification did not change
sge_qmaster you may skip this step, but be aware that changes in some libraries,
like for instance the scheduler library, may also modify sge_qmaster. Carry
out the test if you are not 100% sure.)</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font class="ParagraphHeader">Shutdown the system</font></li>

build</font></li>

<ul><tt>expect check.exp all 1</tt>
<br><tt></tt>&nbsp;</ul>

<li>
<font class="ParagraphHeader">Compare results with validation run</font></li>

<p><br>Stop if the results are not equal.
