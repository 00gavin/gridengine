Dependencies for Solaris 7 and later
------------------------------------

Processor Sets:

	CODINE/GRD supports Solaris processor sets (see psrset(1)). The
	"processors" queue configuration parameter is interpreted as a
	processor set ID number. CODINE/GRD assigns the jobs started in a
	queue to a valid processor set referenced by the "processors" entry.
	Processor sets have to be created and managed outside CODINE/GRD,
	for instance with the psradm(1) command.

	Processor set affinity can only be assigned with root permission.
	Thus CODINE/GRD will only make use of the definitions in the
	"processors" queue configuration parameter if the execution daemon
	and thus the shepherd process are started with root permission.
