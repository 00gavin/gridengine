NAME
     sge_execd - Grid Engine job execution agent

SYNOPSIS
     sge_execd [ -help ] [ -lj log_file ] [ -nostart-commd ]

DESCRIPTION
     <I>sge</I>_<I>execd</I> controls the  Grid  Engine  queues  local  to  the
     machine  <I>sge</I>_<I>execd</I>  is  running on and executes/controls the
     jobs sent from <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> to be run on these queues.
     Together  with  <I>sge</I>_<I>execd</I>  a  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_commd.html">sge_commd(8)</A></B>  is  brought   up
     automatically on the same machine (if not already present).

OPTIONS
  -help
     Prints  a listing of all options.

  -lj log_file
     Enables job logging. All actions  taken  by  <I>sge</I>_<I>execd</I>  from
     receiving  the  job until returning it to <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> are
     logged to the log_file. This feature is also available  with
     the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> daemon.

  -nostart-commd
     Do not start up <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_commd.html">sge_commd(8)</A></B>  automatically  with  <I>sge</I>_<I>execd</I>
     and evaluate the COMMD_HOST environment variable to find the
     corresponding <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_commd.html">sge_commd(8)</A></B>.

LOAD SENSORS
     If a load sensor is configured for <I>sge</I>_<I>execd</I> via either  the
     global  or the execution host specific cluster configuration
     (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B>) the executable path of the load sensor  is
     invoked  by <I>sge</I>_<I>execd</I> on a regular basis and delivers one or
     multiple load figures for the execution  host  (e.g.   users
     currently  logged  in) or on the complete cluster (e.g. free
     disk space on a network wide scratch file system). The  load
     sensor  may  be  a  script or a binary executable. In either
     case its handling of the STDIN and  STDOUT  stream  and  its
     control flow must comply to the following rules:

     The load sensor has to be written as infinite  loop  waiting
     at  a certain point for input from STDIN. If the string quit
     is read from STDIN, the load sensor is supposed to exit.  As
     soon  as  an  end-of-line  is  read  from  STDIN a load data
     retrieval cycle is supposed to start. The load  sensor  then
     performs  whatever  operation  is  necessary  to compute the
     desired load figures.  At the end of the cycle the load sen-
     sor writes the result to stdout. The format is as follows:

     <B>o</B>  A load value report starts with a line containing nothing
        but the word start.

     <B>o</B>  Individual load values are separated by newlines.

     <B>o</B>  Each load value report consists of three parts  separated
        by colons (":") and containing no blanks.

     <B>o</B>  The first part of a load value information is either  the
        name  of  the host for which load is reported or the spe-
        cial name "global".

     <B>o</B>  The second part is the symbolic name of the load value as
        defined  in  the  host  or  global complex list (see <I>com-</I>
        <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/plex.html">plex(5)</A></B> for details). If a load  value  is  reported  for
        which no entry in the host or global complex list exists,
        the reported load value is not used.

     <B>o</B>  The third part is the measured load value.

     <B>o</B>  A load value report ends with a line with the word end.

ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
     SGE_ROOT       Specifies the location  of  the  Grid  Engine
                    standard configuration files.

     SGE_CELL       If set, specifies  the  default  Grid  Engine
                    cell. To address a Grid Engine cell <I>sge</I>_<I>execd</I>
                    uses (in the order of precedence):

                         The name of the cell  specified  in  the
                         environment  variable SGE_CELL, if it is
                         set.

                         The  name  of  the  default  cell,  i.e.
                         default.


     SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL
                    If  set,  specifies  that  debug  information
                    should  be written to stderr. In addition the
                    level of detail in which debug information is
                    generated is defined.

     COMMD_PORT     If set,  specifies  the  tcp  port  on  which
                    <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_commd.html">sge_commd(8)</A></B>  is  expected to listen for com-
                    munication requests.  Most installations will
                    use  a  services  map entry instead to define
                    that port.

     COMMD_HOST     If set, specifies the host on which the  par-
                    ticular  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_commd.html">sge_commd(8)</A></B>  to  be  used  for Grid
                    Engine communication of the <I>sge</I>_<I>execd</I>  client
                    resides.   Only  evaluated  if  the -nostart-
                    commd option was specified at  the  <I>sge</I>_<I>execd</I>
                    command-line.   Per default the local host is
                    used.

RESTRICTIONS
     <I>sge</I>_<I>execd</I> usually is started from root on  each  machine  in
     the  Grid Engine pool.  If started by a normal user, a spool
     directory must be used to  which  the  user  has  read/write
     access.  In this case only jobs being submitted by that same
     user are treated correctly by the system.

FILES
     &lt;<I>sge</I>_<I>root</I>&gt;/&lt;<I>cell</I>&gt;/<I>common</I>/<I>configuration</I>
                     Grid Engine global configuration
