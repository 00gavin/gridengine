NAME
     sge_shepherd - Grid Engine single job controlling agent

SYNOPSIS
     sge_shepherd

DESCRIPTION
     <I>sge</I>_<I>shepherd</I> provides the parent process functionality for a
     single  Grid Engine job.  The parent functionality is neces-
     sary on UNIX systems to retrieve resource usage  information
     (see  <B><A HREF="../htmlman2/getrusage.html">getrusage(2)</A></B>)  after  a job has finished. In addition,
     the <I>sge</I>_<I>shepherd</I> forwards signals to the job,  such  as  the
     signals  for  suspension, enabling, termination and the Grid
     Engine checkpointing signal (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_ckpt.html">sge_ckpt(1)</A></B> for details).

     The <I>sge</I>_<I>shepherd</I> receives information about the job to start
     from  the  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B>.  During the execution of the job it
     actually starts up to 5  child  processes.  First  a  prolog
     script if this feature is enabled by the prolog parameter in
     the cluster configuration (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B>).  Then a  paral-
     lel  environment startup script if the job is a parallel job
     (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_pe.html">sge_pe(5)</A></B> for more information).   Afterwards  the  job
     itself followed by a parallel environment shutdown procedure
     for parallel jobs, and finally an epilog script if requested
     by  the  epilog  parameter in the cluster configuration. The
     prolog and epilog scripts as well as the  parallel  environ-
     ment  startup  and shutdown procedures are to be provided by
     the Grid Engine administration and  are  intended  for  site
     specific  actions  to  be taken prior and after execution of
     the actual user job.

     After the job has finished and the  epilog  script  is  pro-
     cessed,  <I>sge</I>_<I>shepherd</I>  retrieves  resource  usage statistics
     about the job, places them in a job specific subdirectory of
     the  spool  directory  of <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> for reporting through
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> and finishes.

RESTRICTIONS
     <I>sge</I>_<I>shepherd</I> should not be invoked  manually,  but  only  by
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B>.

     &lt;<I>execd</I>_<I>spool</I>&gt;/<I>job</I>_<I>dir</I>/&lt;<I>job</I>_<I>id</I>&gt;     job specific directory
