NAME
     sge_types - Grid Engine type descriptions

DESCRIPTION
     The Grid Engine user interface consists of several  programs
     and files. Some commandline switches and several file attri-
     butes are types. The syntax for these types is explained  in
     this page.

TYPES
     The syntax of Grid Engine types in alphabetic order:

  pattern
     When  ever  patterns  are  used  the  following   definition
     applies:

     "*"     matches any character and any number of characters
             (between 0 and inv).
     "?"     matches any character. It cannot be no character
     "."     is the character ".". It has no other meaning
     "\"     escape character. "\\" = "\", "\*" = "*", "\?" = "?"
     "[xx]"  specifies an array or a range of allowed
             characters for one character at a specific position

     The pattern itself should be put into '"'  to  ensure,  that
     the clients get the pattern. The or '|' operator is not sup-
     ported.

  range
     The task range specifier has the form

     n[-m[:s]][,n[-m[:s]], ...] or n[-m[:s]][ n[-m[:s]] ...]

     and thus consists of a comma  or  blank  separated  list  of
     range  specifiers  n[-m[:s]]. The ranges are concatenated to
     the complete task id range.  Each  range  may  be  a  single
     number,  a  simple  range  of the form n-m or a range with a
     step size.

  wc_host
     A  wildcard  host  specification  (<I>wc</I>_<I>host</I>)  is  a  wildcard
     expression  which  might match one or more hosts used in the
     cluster.  The first character of that  string  never  begins
     with an at-charcter '@' even if the expression begins with a
     wildcard character.

     e.g.
          *            all hosts
          a*           all host beginning with an 'a'

  wc_hostgroup
     A  wildcard  hostgroup  specification  (<I>wc</I>_<I>hostgroup</I>)  is  a
     wildcard  expression  which  might  match  one or more host-
     groups.  The first charcter of that string is always  a  at-
     charcter '@'.

     More information concerning hostgroups can be found in <I>host-</I>
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/group.html">group(5)</A></B>

     e.g.
          @*           all hostgroups in the cluster
          @solaris     the @solaris hostgroup

  wc_job
     The wildcard job specification is a placeholder for job ids,
     job  names  include  job name wildcard expressions. A job id
     allways references one job, while  the  names  and  patterns
     might reference multiple jobs.

     wc_job := job-id | job-name | pattern

  wc_job_range
     The wildcard job range  specification  allows  to  reference
     specific  array  tasks  for  one or multipe jobs. The job is
     referenced via wc_job and in addition gets a range specifier
     for the array tasks.

     wc_job_range := wc_job [ -t range]

  wc_job_list
     The wildcard job list specification allows to reference mul-
     tiple jobs with one command.

     wc_job_list := wc_job [ , wc_job , ...]

  wc_job_range_list
     The wildcard job range list (<I>wc</I>_<I>job</I>_<I>range</I>_<I>list</I>) is specified
     by one of the following forms:

         <I>wc</I>_<I>job</I>[ -<I>t</I> <I>range</I>][{, }<I>wc</I>_<I>job</I>[ -<I>t</I> <I>range</I>]{, }...]

     If present, the <I>task</I>_<I>range</I> restricts the effect of the  <I>qmod</I>
     operation to the array job task range specified as suffix to
     the job id (see the -t option to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> for further details
     on array jobs).

  wc_qdomain
     <I>wc</I>_<I>qdomain</I> := <I>wc</I>_<I>cqueue</I> "@" <I>wc</I>_<I>hostgroup</I>

     A wildcard queue domain  specification  (<I>wc</I>_<I>qdomain</I>)  starts
     with  a  wildcard cluster queue name (<I>wc</I>_<I>cqueue</I>) followed by
     an at-character '@' and a wildcard  hostgroup  specification
     (<I>wc</I>_<I>hostgroup</I>).

     <I>wc</I>_<I>qdomain</I> are used to address a group of  queue  instances.
     All  queue  instances  residing  on a hosts which is part of
     matching hostgroups will be  addressed.  Please  note,  that
     <I>wc</I>_<I>hostgroup</I> always begins with an at-character.

     e.g.
          *@@*         all queue instances whose underlaying
                       host is part of at least one hostgroup
          *@@solaris   all queue instances on hosts part of
                       the @solaris hostgroup

  wc_cqueue
     A wildcard cluster  queue  specification  (<I>wc</I>_<I>cqueue</I>)  is  a
     wildcard  expression  which  might match one or more cluster
     queues used in the cluster.  That string never  contains  an
     at-charcter  '@'  even if the expression begins with a wild-
     card character.

     e.g.
          *            all cluster queues
          a*           all cluster queues beginning with an 'a'

  wc_qinstance
     <I>wc</I>_<I>qinstance</I> := <I>wc</I>_<I>cqueue</I> "@" <I>wc</I>_<I>host</I>

     A  wildcard  queue  instance  specification   (<I>wc</I>_<I>qinstance</I>)
     starts  with  a wildcard cluster queue name (<I>wc</I>_<I>cqueue</I>) fol-
     lowed  by  an  at-character  '@'  and  a  wildcard  hostname
     (<I>wc</I>_<I>host</I>).

     <I>wc</I>_<I>qinstance</I> expressions are used  to  address  a  group  of
     queue instances whose underlaying hostname matches the given
     pattern.  Please note that the first  character  of  <I>wc</I>_<I>host</I>
     does never match the at-character '@'.

     e.g.
          *@*          all queue instances in the cluster
          *@b*         all queue instances whose
                       hostname begins with a 'b'

  wc_queue
     <I>wc</I>_<I>queue</I> := <I>wc</I>_<I>cqueue</I> | <I>wc</I>_<I>qdomain</I> | <I>wc</I>_<I>qinstance</I>

     A wildcard queue expression (<I>wc</I>_<I>queue</I>)  might  either  be  a
     wildcard  cluster queue specification (<I>wc</I>_<I>cqueue</I>) or a wild-
     card queue domain specification (<I>wc</I>_<I>qdomain</I>) or  a  wildcard
     queue instance specification (<I>wc</I>_<I>qinstance</I>).

     e.g.
          big_*1           cluster queues which beginn with
                           "big_" and end with "1"
          big_11@@solaris  @solaris queue domain
          *@fangorn        all qinstances residing on host
                           fangorn

  wc_queue_list
     <I>wc</I>_<I>queue</I>_<I>list</I> := <I>wc</I>_<I>queue</I> ["," <I>wc</I>_<I>queue</I> "," ...]

     Comma separated list of wildcard queue expressions.

     e.g.
          big, medium_*@@sol*, *@fangorn.sun.com

  wc_user
     A wildcard user name expression is either  a  wildcard  user
     name specification or a full user name.

     wc_user := user_name | pattern


  wc_user_list
     A list of user names.

     wc_user_list := wc_user [ , wc_user , ...]
