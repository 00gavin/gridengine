NAME
     sge_types - Grid Engine type descriptions

DESCRIPTION
     The Grid Engine user interface consists of several  programs
     and  files.  Some  command-line  switches  and  several file
     attributes  are  types.  The  syntax  for  these  types   is
     explained in this page.

TYPES
     The syntax of Grid Engine types in alphabetic order:

  expression
     The wildcard expression is a regular boolean expression that
     consists  of  a couple of <I>pattern</I>'s joined by boolean opera-
     tors and priority brackets. When ever  expression  are  used
     the following definition applies:

     expression= ["!"] ["("] valExp [")"] [ AND_OR expression  ]*
     valExp  = pattern | expression AND_OR  = "&amp;" | "|"

     where:

     "!"     not operator negate the following pattern or expresion
     "&amp;"     and operator logically and with the following expression
     "|"     or operator logically or with the following expression
     "("     open bracket begin the priority evaluated expression. The close bracket is required
     ")"     close bracket ends the priority evaluated expression.
     "pattern"see the <I>pattern</I> definition

     The wildcard expresion itself should  be  put  into  '"'  to
     ensure, that the clients get the expression.

     e.g.
          "!(lx*|sol*)&amp;*64*"not begin with lx or sol, but contain
          64 "(rh_3*|suse_[89]*)&amp;!rh_3.1"attribute rh_3*, suse_8*
          or suse_9*, but do not on a rh_3.1


  pattern
     When  ever  patterns  are  used  the  following   definition
     applies:

     "*"     matches any character and any number of characters
             (between 0 and inv).
     "?"     matches any character. It cannot be no character
     "."     is the character ".". It has no other meaning
     "\"     escape character. "\\" = "\", "\*" = "*", "\?" = "?"
     "[...]" specifies an array or a range of allowed
             characters for one character at a specific position.
             Character ranges may be specified using the a-z notation.
             The caret symbol (^) is not interpreted as a logical
             not; it is intrepreted literally.

     For more details please see
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/fnmatch.html">fnmatch(5)</A></B>


     The pattern itself should be put into '"'  to  ensure,  that
     the clients get the pattern. The or '|' operator is not sup-
     ported.

  range
     The task range specifier has the form

     n[-m[:s]][,n[-m[:s]], ...] or n[-m[:s]][ n[-m[:s]] ...]

     and thus consists of a comma  or  blank  separated  list  of
     range  specifiers  n[-m[:s]]. The ranges are concatenated to
     the complete task id range.  Each  range  may  be  a  single
     number,  a  simple  range  of the form n-m or a range with a
     step size.

  wc_host
     A  wildcard  host  specification  (<I>wc</I>_<I>host</I>)  is  a  wildcard
     expression  which  might match one or more hosts used in the
     cluster.  The first character of that  string  never  begins
     with  an  at-character  ('@'), even if the expression begins
     with a wildcard character.

     e.g.
          *            all hosts
          a*           all host beginning with an 'a'

  wc_hostgroup
     A wildcard hostgroup specification (<I>wc</I>_<I>hostgroup</I>) is a wild-
     card  expression  which  might match one or more hostgroups.
     The first character of that string is always an at-character
     ('@').

     More information concerning hostgroups can be found in <I>host-</I>
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/group.html">group(5)</A></B>

     e.g.
          @*           all hostgroups in the cluster
          @solaris     the @solaris hostgroup

  wc_job
     The wildcard job specification is a placeholder for job ids,
     job  names  include job name pattern. A job id always refer-
     ences one job, while the names and pattern  might  reference
     multiple jobs.

     wc_job := job-id | job-name | pattern

  wc_job_range
     The wildcard job range  specification  allows  to  reference
     specific  array  tasks  for  one or multipe jobs. The job is
     referenced via wc_job and in addition gets a range specifier
     for the array tasks.

     wc_job_range := wc_job [ -t range]

  wc_job_list
     The wildcard job list specification allows to reference mul-
     tiple jobs with one command.

     wc_job_list := wc_job [ , wc_job , ...]

  wc_job_range_list
     The wildcard job range list (<I>wc</I>_<I>job</I>_<I>range</I>_<I>list</I>) is specified
     by one of the following forms:

         <I>wc</I>_<I>job</I>[ -<I>t</I> <I>range</I>][{, }<I>wc</I>_<I>job</I>[ -<I>t</I> <I>range</I>]{, }...]

     If present, the <I>task</I>_<I>range</I> restricts the effect of the  <I>qmod</I>
     operation to the array job task range specified as suffix to
     the job id (see the -t option to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> for further details
     on array jobs).

  wc_qdomain
     <I>wc</I>_<I>qdomain</I> := <I>wc</I>_<I>cqueue</I> "@" <I>wc</I>_<I>hostgroup</I>

     A   wildcard   expression   queue    domain    specification
     (<I>wc</I>_<I>qdomain</I>) starts with a wildcard expression cluster queue
     name (<I>wc</I>_<I>cqueue</I>) followed by an at-character '@' and a wild-
     card expression hostgroup specification (<I>wc</I>_<I>hostgroup</I>).

     <I>wc</I>_<I>qdomain</I> are used to address a group of  queue  instances.
     All  queue  instances  residing  on a hosts which is part of
     matching hostgroups will be  addressed.  Please  note,  that
     <I>wc</I>_<I>hostgroup</I> always begins with an at-character.

     e.g.
          *@@*         all queue instances whose underlying
                       host is part of at least one hostgroup
          a*@@e*       all queue instances begins with a whose underlying
                       host is part of at least one hostgroup begin with e
          *@@solaris   all queue instances on hosts part of
                       the @solaris hostgroup

  wc_cqueue
     A   wildcard   expression   cluster   queue    specification
     (<I>wc</I>_<I>cqueue</I>)  is  a wildcard expression which might match one
     or more cluster queues used in  the  cluster.   That  string
     never contains an at-character ('@'), even if the expression
     begins with a wildcard character.
     e.g.
          *            all cluster queues
          a*           all cluster queues beginning with an 'a'
          a*&amp;!adam     all cluster queues beginning with an 'a',but not adam

  wc_qinstance
     <I>wc</I>_<I>qinstance</I> := <I>wc</I>_<I>cqueue</I> "@" <I>wc</I>_<I>host</I>

     A   wildcard   expression   queue   instance   specification
     (<I>wc</I>_<I>qinstance</I>)  starts  with  a  wildcard expression cluster
     queue name (<I>wc</I>_<I>cqueue</I>) followed by an at-character '@' and a
     wildcard expression hostname (<I>wc</I>_<I>host</I>).

     <I>wc</I>_<I>qinstance</I> expressions are used  to  address  a  group  of
     queue instances whose underlying hostname matches the given
     expression.  Please note that the first character of <I>wc</I>_<I>host</I>
     does never match the at-character '@'.

     e.g.
          *@*          all queue instances in the cluster
          *@b*         all queue instances whose
                       hostname begins with a 'b'
          *@b*|c*      all queue instances whose
                       hostname begins with a 'b' or 'c'

  wc_queue
     <I>wc</I>_<I>queue</I> := <I>wc</I>_<I>cqueue</I> | <I>wc</I>_<I>qdomain</I> | <I>wc</I>_<I>qinstance</I>

     A wildcard queue expression (<I>wc</I>_<I>queue</I>)  might  either  be  a
     wildcard  expression cluster queue specification (<I>wc</I>_<I>cqueue</I>)
     or  a  wildcard  expression   queue   domain   specification
     (<I>wc</I>_<I>qdomain</I>) or a wildcard expression queue instance specif-
     ication (<I>wc</I>_<I>qinstance</I>).

     e.g.
          big_*1           cluster queues which begin with
                           "big_" and end with "1"
          big_*&amp;!*1        cluster queues which begin with
                           "big_" ,but does not end with "1"
          *@fangorn        all qinstances residing on host
                           fangorn

  wc_queue_list
     <I>wc</I>_<I>queue</I>_<I>list</I> := <I>wc</I>_<I>queue</I> ["," <I>wc</I>_<I>queue</I> "," ...]

     Comma separated list of wc_queue elements.

     e.g.
          big, medium_*@@sol*, *@fangorn.sun.com

  wc_user
     A wildcard user name pattern is either a wildcard user  name
     specification or a full user name.

     wc_user := user_name | pattern

  wc_user_list
     A list of user names.

     wc_user_list := wc_user [ , wc_user , ...]

  wc_project
     A wildcard project name pattern is either a wildcard project
     name specification or a full project name.

     wc_project := project | pattern

  wc_pe_name
     A wildcard parallel environment name  pattern  is  either  a
     wildcard pe name specification or a full pe name.

     wc_pe_name := pe_name | pattern
