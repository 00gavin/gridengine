NAME
     sge_types - Grid Engine type descriptions

DESCRIPTION
     The Grid Engine user interface consists of several  programs
     and  files.  Some  command-line  switches  and  several file
     attributes  are  types.  The  syntax  for  these  types   is
     explained in this page.

OBJECT TYPES
     These types are used for defining Grid Engine configuration:

  calendar_name
     A calendar name is  the  name  of  a  Grid  Engine  calendar
     described in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/calendar_conf.html">calendar_conf(5)</A></B>.

     <I>calendar</I>_<I>name</I> := <I>object</I>_<I>name</I>

  ckpt_name
     A "ckpt_name" is the name of  a  Grid  Engine  checkpointing
     interface described in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/checkpoint.html">checkpoint(5)</A></B>.

     <I>ckpt</I>_<I>name</I> := <I>object</I>_<I>name</I>

  complex_name
     A complex name is the name of a Grid Engine resource  attri-
     bute described in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html">complex(5)</A></B>.

     <I>complex</I>_<I>name</I> := <I>object</I>_<I>name</I>

  host_identifier
     A host identifier can be either a host name or a host  group
     name.

     <I>host</I>_<I>identifier</I> := <I>host</I>_<I>name</I> | <I>hostgroup</I>_<I>name</I>

  hostgroup_name
     A host group name is the name of a Grid  Engine  host  group
     described  in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/hostgroup.html">hostgroup(5)</A></B>.  Note, to allow host group names
     easily be differed from host names a "@" prefix is used.

     <I>hostgroup</I>_<I>name</I> := @<I>object</I>_<I>name</I>

  host_name
     A host name is the official name of a host node. Host  names
     with a domain specification such as "gridmaster.sun.com" are
     called fully-qualified host names, whereas host  names  like
     "gridmaster"  are  called  short host names. Note, there are
     the install time parameters default_domain  and  ignore_fqdn
     (see  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/bootstrap.html">bootstrap(5)</A></B>)  which affect how Grid Engine deals with
     host names in general.

  memory_specifier
     Memory specifiers are positive decimal, hexadecimal or octal
     integer  constants  which  may  be  followed by a multiplier
     letter. Valid multiplier letters are k, K, m, M,  g  and  G,
     where  k  means  multiply  the  value by 1000, K multiply by
     1024, m multiply by 1000*1000, M multiply  by  1024*1024,  g
     multiply by 1000*1000*1000 and G multiply by 1024*1024*1024.
     If no multiplier is present, the value is  just  counted  in
     bytes.

  pe_name
     A "pe_name" is the name of a Grid Engine  parallel  environ-
     ment described in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_pe.html">sge_pe(5)</A></B>.

     <I>pe</I>_<I>name</I> := <I>object</I>_<I>name</I>

  project_name
     A project  name  is  the  name  of  a  Grid  Engine  project
     described in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/project.html">project(5)</A></B>.

     <I>project</I>_<I>name</I> := <I>object</I>_<I>name</I>

  queue_name
     A queue name is the name of a Grid Engine queue described in
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>.

     <I>queue</I>_<I>name</I>  := <I>object</I>_<I>name</I>

  time_specifier
     A time specifier either consists of a positive decimal, hex-
     adecimal  or octal integer constant, in which case the value
     is interpreted to be in seconds, or is built  by  3  decimal
     integer  numbers  separated  by  colon signs where the first
     number counts the hours, the  second  the  minutes  and  the
     third  the  seconds.  If a number is zero it can be left out
     but the separating colon must  remain  (e.g.  1:0:1  =  1::1
     means 1 hours and 1 second).

  user_name
     A user name can be the name of a <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/login.html">login(1)</A></B>  user  or  of  the
     Grid Engine user object described in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/user.html">user(5)</A></B>.

     <I>user</I>_<I>name</I> := <I>object</I>_<I>name</I>

  userset_name
     A user set name is the name of an Grid Engine access list or
     department described in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/access_list.html">access_list(5)</A></B>.

     <I>userset</I>_<I>name</I> := <I>object</I>_<I>name</I>

  object_name
     An object name is a sequence  of  up  to  512  ASCII  string
     characters except "\n", "\t", "\r", " ", "/", ":", "'", "\",
     "[", "]", "{", "}", "|", "(", ")", "@", "%", ","  or  the  "
     character itself.

MATCHING TYPES
     These types are used for matching Grid Engine configuration:

  expression
     A wildcard expression is a regular boolean  expression  that
     consists  of  one  or more <I>pattern</I>s joined by boolean opera-
     tors. When a wildcard  expression  is  used,  the  following
     definition applies:

     expression= ["!"] ["("] valExp [")"] [ AND_OR expression ]*
     valExp  = pattern | expression
     AND_OR  = "&amp;" | "|"

     where:

     "!"       not operator -- negate the following pattern or expression
     "&amp;"       and operator -- logically and with the following expression
     "|"       or operator -- logically or with the following expression
     "("       open bracket -- begin an inner expression.
     ")"       close bracket -- end an inner expression.
     "pattern" see the <I>pattern</I> definition that's follow

     The expression itself should be put inside quotes  ('"')  to
     ensure that clients receive the complete expression.

     e.g.
          "(lx*|sol*)&amp;*64*" any string beginning with either "lx" or
                            "sol" and containing "64"
          "rh_3*&amp;!rh_3.1"   any string beginning with "rh_3", except
                            "rh_3.1"

  pattern
     When patterns are used the following definitions apply:

     "*"     matches any character and any number of characters
             (between 0 and inv).
     "?"     matches any character. It must be a character other that the empty
             string
     "."     is the character ".". It has no other meaning
     "\"     escape character. "\\" = "\", "\*" = "*", "\?" = "?"
     "[...]" specifies an array or a range of allowed
             characters for one character at a specific position.
             Character ranges may be specified using the a-z notation.
             The caret symbol (^) is not interpreted as a logical
             not; it is interpreted literally.

     For more details please see
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/fnmatch.html">fnmatch(5)</A></B>
     The pattern itself should be  put  inside  quotes  ('"')  to
     ensure that clients receive the complete pattern.

  range
     The task range specifier has the form

     n[-m[:s]][,n[-m[:s]], ...] or n[-m[:s]][ n[-m[:s]] ...]

     and thus consists of a comma  or  blank  separated  list  of
     range  specifiers  n[-m[:s]]. The ranges are concatenated to
     the complete task id range.  Each  range  may  be  a  single
     number,  a  simple  range  of the form n-m or a range with a
     step size.

  wc_host
     A  wildcard  host  specification  (<I>wc</I>_<I>host</I>)  is  a  wildcard
     expression  which  might match one or more hosts used in the
     cluster.  The first character of that  string  never  begins
     with  an  at-character  ('@'), even if the expression begins
     with a wildcard character.

     e.g.
          *            all hosts
          a*           all host beginning with an 'a'

  wc_hostgroup
     A wildcard hostgroup specification (<I>wc</I>_<I>hostgroup</I>) is a wild-
     card  expression  which  might match one or more hostgroups.
     The first character of that string is always an at-character
     ('@').

     More information concerning hostgroups can be found in <I>host-</I>
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/group.html">group(5)</A></B>

     e.g.
          @*           all hostgroups in the cluster
          @solaris     the @solaris hostgroup

  wc_job
     The wildcard job specification is a placeholder for job ids,
     job  names  include job name pattern. A job id always refer-
     ences one job, while the names and pattern  might  reference
     multiple jobs.

     wc_job := job-id | job-name | pattern

  wc_job_range
     The wildcard job range  specification  allows  to  reference
     specific  array  tasks  for one or multiple jobs. The job is
     referenced via wc_job and in addition gets a range specifier
     for the array tasks.

     wc_job_range := wc_job [ -t range]

  wc_job_list
     The wildcard job list specification allows to reference mul-
     tiple jobs with one command.

     wc_job_list := wc_job [ , wc_job , ...]

  wc_job_range_list
     The wildcard job range list (<I>wc</I>_<I>job</I>_<I>range</I>_<I>list</I>) is specified
     by one of the following forms:

         <I>wc</I>_<I>job</I>[ -<I>t</I> <I>range</I>][{, }<I>wc</I>_<I>job</I>[ -<I>t</I> <I>range</I>]{, }...]

     If present, the <I>task</I>_<I>range</I> restricts the effect of the  <I>qmod</I>
     operation to the array job task range specified as suffix to
     the job id (see the -t option to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> for further details
     on array jobs).

  wc_qdomain
     <I>wc</I>_<I>qdomain</I> := <I>wc</I>_<I>cqueue</I> "@" <I>wc</I>_<I>hostgroup</I>

     A   wildcard   expression   queue    domain    specification
     (<I>wc</I>_<I>qdomain</I>) starts with a wildcard expression cluster queue
     name (<I>wc</I>_<I>cqueue</I>) followed by an at-character '@' and a wild-
     card expression hostgroup specification (<I>wc</I>_<I>hostgroup</I>).

     <I>wc</I>_<I>qdomain</I> are used to address a group of  queue  instances.
     All  queue  instances  residing  on a hosts which is part of
     matching hostgroups will be  addressed.  Please  note,  that
     <I>wc</I>_<I>hostgroup</I> always begins with an at-character.

     e.g.
          *@@*         all queue instances whose underlying
                       host is part of at least one hostgroup
          a*@@e*       all queue instances beginning with an 'a' whose underlying
                       host is part of at least one hostgroup beginning with 'e'
          *@@solaris   all queue instances on hosts part of
                       the @solaris hostgroup

  wc_cqueue
     A   wildcard   expression   cluster   queue    specification
     (<I>wc</I>_<I>cqueue</I>)  is  a wildcard expression which might match one
     or more cluster queues used in  the  cluster.   That  string
     never contains an at-character ('@'), even if the expression
     begins with a wildcard character.

     e.g.
          *            all cluster queues
          a*           all cluster queues beginning with an 'a'
          a*&amp;!adam     all cluster queues beginning with an 'a',but not adam

  wc_qinstance
     <I>wc</I>_<I>qinstance</I> := <I>wc</I>_<I>cqueue</I> "@" <I>wc</I>_<I>host</I>

     A   wildcard   expression   queue   instance   specification
     (<I>wc</I>_<I>qinstance</I>)  starts  with  a  wildcard expression cluster
     queue name (<I>wc</I>_<I>cqueue</I>) followed by an at-character '@' and a
     wildcard expression hostname (<I>wc</I>_<I>host</I>).

     <I>wc</I>_<I>qinstance</I> expressions are used  to  address  a  group  of
     queue  instances whose underlying hostname matches the given
     expression.  Please note that the first character of <I>wc</I>_<I>host</I>
     does not match the at-character '@'.

     e.g.
          *@*          all queue instances in the cluster
          *@b*         all queue instances whose
                       hostname begins with a 'b'
          *@b*|c*      all queue instances whose
                       hostname begins with a 'b' or 'c'

  wc_queue
     <I>wc</I>_<I>queue</I> := <I>wc</I>_<I>cqueue</I> | <I>wc</I>_<I>qdomain</I> | <I>wc</I>_<I>qinstance</I>

     A wildcard queue expression (<I>wc</I>_<I>queue</I>)  might  either  be  a
     wildcard  expression cluster queue specification (<I>wc</I>_<I>cqueue</I>)
     or  a  wildcard  expression   queue   domain   specification
     (<I>wc</I>_<I>qdomain</I>) or a wildcard expression queue instance specif-
     ication (<I>wc</I>_<I>qinstance</I>).

     e.g.
          big_*1           cluster queues which begin with
                           "big_" and end with "1"
          big_*&amp;!*1        cluster queues which begin with
                           "big_" ,but does not end with "1"
          *@fangorn        all qinstances residing on host
                           fangorn

  wc_queue_list
     <I>wc</I>_<I>queue</I>_<I>list</I> := <I>wc</I>_<I>queue</I> ["," <I>wc</I>_<I>queue</I> "," ...]

     Comma separated list of wc_queue elements.

     e.g.
          big, medium_*@@sol*, *@fangorn.sun.com

  wc_user
     A wildcard user name pattern is either a wildcard user  name
     specification or a full user name.

     wc_user := user_name | pattern


  wc_user_list
     A list of user names.

     wc_user_list := wc_user [ , wc_user , ...]

  wc_project
     A wildcard project name pattern is either a wildcard project
     name specification or a full project name.

     wc_project := project | pattern

  wc_pe_name
     A wildcard parallel environment name  pattern  is  either  a
     wildcard PE name specification or a full PE name.

     wc_pe_name := pe_name | pattern
