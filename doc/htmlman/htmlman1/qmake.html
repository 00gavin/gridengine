NAME
     qmake  -  distributed  parallel  make,  scheduling  by  Grid
     Engine.

SYNTAX
     qmake [ options ] -- [ gmake options ]

DESCRIPTION
     <I>Qmake</I> is a parallel, distributed <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/make.html">make(1)</A></B> utility. Scheduling
     of  the  parallel  <I>make</I>  tasks is done by Grid Engine. It is
     based on <I>gmake</I> (GNU make), version 3.78.1. Both Grid  Engine
     and  <I>gmake</I>  commandline  options  can be specified. They are
     separated by "--".

     All Grid Engine options valid with <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> or <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrsh.html">qrsh(1)</A></B> can be
     specified  with  <I>qmake</I>  - see <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/submit.html">submit(1)</A></B> for a description of
     all Grid Engine commandline  options.   The  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/make.html">make(1)</A></B>  manual
     page describes the <I>gmake</I> commandline syntax.

     The syntax of <I>qmake</I> makefiles corresponds to  <I>gmake</I>  and  is
     described in the "GNU Make Manual".

EXAMPLES
          qmake -pe compiling 1-10 --

     will request between 1 and 10 slots in parallel  environment
     "compiling" on the same architecture as the submit host. The
     <I>make</I> tasks will inherit the complete environment of the cal-
     ling  shell. It will execute as many parallel tasks as slots
     have been granted by Grid Engine.

          qmake -- -j 4

     will request between 1 and 4 slots in  parallel  environment
     "make" on the same architecture as the submit host.

          qmake -l arch=solaris -pe make 3

     will request 3 parallel <I>make</I> tasks to be executed  on  hosts
     of  architecture "solaris". The submit may be done on a host
     of any architecture.

     The shell script

          #!/bin/sh
          qmake -inherit --

     can be submitted by

          qsub -pe make 1-10 [furter sge options] &lt;script&gt;

     <I>Qmake</I>  will  inherit  the  resources  granted  for  the  job
     sumbitted above under parallel environment "make".

ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
     SGE_ROOT       Specifies the location  of  the  Grid  Engine
                    standard configuration files.

     SGE_CELL       If set, specifies  the  default  Grid  Engine
                    cell.  To  address  a  Grid Engine cell <I>qmake</I>
                    uses (in the order of precedence):

                         The name of the cell  specified  in  the
                         environment  variable SGE_CELL, if it is
                         set.

                         The  name  of  the  default  cell,  i.e.
                         default.


     SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL
                    If  set,  specifies  that  debug  information
                    should  be written to stderr. In addition the
                    level of detail in which debug information is
                    generated is defined.

     COMMD_PORT     If set,  specifies  the  tcp  port  on  which
                    <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_commd.html">sge_commd(8)</A></B>  is  expected to listen for com-
                    munication requests.  Most installations will
                    use  a  services  map entry instead to define
                    that port.

     COMMD_HOST     If set, specifies the host on which the  par-
                    ticular  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_commd.html">sge_commd(8)</A></B>  to  be  used  for Grid
                    Engine  communication  of  the  <I>qmake</I>  client
                    resides.  Per default the local host is used.

KNOWN PROBLEMS
  Slow NFS server
     Very low file server performance may  lead  to  problems  on
     depending files.

     Example: Host a compiles a.c to a.o, host b compiles b.c  to
     b.o,  host  c shall link program c from a.o and b.o. In case
     of very bad NFS performance, host c might not yet see  files
     a.o and b.o.

  Multiple commands in one rule
     If multiple commands are executed in one rule, the  makefile
     has to ensure that they are handled as one commandline.

     Example:

          libx.a:
               cd x
               ar ru libx.a x.o

     Building libx.a will fail, if the commands are  executed  in
     parallel  (and  possibly on different hosts). Write the fol-
     lowing instead:

          libx.a:
               cd x ; ar ru libx.a x.o

     or

          libx.a:
               cd x ; \
               ar ru libx.a x.o
