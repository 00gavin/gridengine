NAME
     qstat - show the status of Grid Engine jobs and queues

SYNTAX
     qstat [ -ext ] [ -f ] [ -F [resource_name,...]  ] [ -g d ] [
     -help  ] [ -j [job_list] ] [ -l resource=val,... ] [ -ne ] [
     -pe  pe_name,...  ]  [  -q  queue,...  ]  [  -r   ]   [   -s
     {r|p|s|z|hu|ho|hs|hj|ha|h}[+]] ] [ -t ] [ -U user,... ] [ -u
     user,... ]

DESCRIPTION
     <I>qstat</I> shows the current status of the available Grid  Engine
     queues  and  the  jobs associated with the queues. Selection
     options allow you to get information  about  specific  jobs,
     queues or users.  Without any option <I>qstat</I> will display only
     a list of jobs with no queue status information.

OPTIONS
     -alarm
          Displays the reason(s) for queue alarm states.  Outputs
          one  line  per reason containing the resource value and
          threshold. For details about the resource value  please
          refer  to the description of the Full Format in section
          OUTPUT FORMATS below.

     -ext This option is only supported in case of a Grid  Engine
          Enterprise Edition system. It is not available for Grid
          Engine systems.
          Displays  additional  Grid  Engine  Enterprise  Edition
          relevant  information  for each job (see OUTPUT FORMATS
          below).

     -f   Specifies a "full" format display of information.   The
          -f  option  causes summary information on all queues to
          be displayed along with the queued job list.

     -F [ resource_name,... ]
          Like in the case of -f information is displayed on  all
          jobs as well as queues. In addition, <I>qstat</I> will present
          a detailed listing of the current resource availability
          per  queue with respect to all resources (if the option
          argument is omitted) or with respect to those resources
          contained  in  the  resource_name list. Please refer to
          the description of the Full Format  in  section  OUTPUT
          FORMATS below for further detail.

     -g d Displays array jobs verbosely in a  one  line  per  job
          task  fashion.  By  default, array jobs are grouped and
          all tasks with the same status (for pending tasks only)
          are  displayed  in a single line. The array job task id
          range field in the output (see section OUTPUT  FORMATS)
          specifies the corresponding set of tasks.
          The -g switch currently  has  only  the  single  option
          argument  d.  Other  option  arguments are reserved for
          future extensions.

     -help
          Prints a listing of all options.

     -j [job_list]
          Prints either for all pending jobs  or  the  jobs  con-
          tained in job_list the reason for not being scheduled.

     -l resource[=value],...
          Defines the resources required by the jobs  or  granted
          by  the  queues  on  which  information  is  requested.
          Matching is performed on queues. The pending  jobs  are
          restricted  to  jobs that might run in one of the above
          queues.

     -ne  In  combination  with  -f  the  option  suppresses  the
          display  of  empty  queues. This means all queues where
          actually no jobs are running are not displayed.

     -pe pe_name,...
          Displays status  information  with  respect  to  queues
          which  are  attached  to  at  least one of the parallel
          environments enlisted in  the  comma  separated  option
          argument.  Status  information  for  jobs  is displayed
          either for those which execute in one of  the  selected
          queues  or which are pending and might get scheduled to
          those queues in principle.

     -q queue,...
          Specifies the queue to which job information is  to  be
          displayed.

     -r   Prints extended information about the resource require-
          ments of the displayed jobs. Please refer to the OUTPUT
          FORMATS sub-section Expanded Format below for  detailed
          information.

     -s {p|r|s|z|hu|ho|hs|hj|ha|h}[+]

          Prints only jobs in the specified state,  any  combina-
          tion  of  states is possible. -s prs corresponds to the
          regular  <I>qstat</I>  output  without  -s  at  all.  To  show
          recently  finished  jobs, use -s z.  To display jobs in
          user/operator/system hold, use the -s hu/ho/hs  option.
          The  -s ha option shows jobs which where submitted with
          the <I>qsub</I> -a command. <I>qstat</I>  -s  hj  displays  all  jobs
          which are not eligible for execution unless the job has
          entries  in  the  job  dependency  list.  (see  -a  and
          -hold_jid option to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>).

     -t   Prints extended information about the  controlled  sub-
          tasks  of  the displayed parallel jobs. Please refer to
          the OUTPUT FORMATS sub-section  Expanded  Format  below
          for  detailed  information.  Sub-tasks of parallel jobs
          should not be confused with array  job  tasks  (see  -g
          option above and -t option to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>).

     -U user,...
          Displays status information with respect to  queues  to
          which  the specified users have access. Status informa-
          tion for jobs is displayed either for those which  exe-
          cute in one of the selected queues or which are pending
          and might get scheduled to those queues in principle.

     -u user,...
          Display information only on those jobs and queues being
          associated  with  the  users  from the given user list.
          Queue status information is displayed if the -f  or  -F
          options are specified additionally and if the user runs
          jobs in those queues.

OUTPUT FORMATS
     Depending on the presence or absence of the -alarm, -f or -F
     and  -r  and  -t option three output formats need to be dif-
     ferentiated.  PP In case of a Grid Engine Enterprise Edition
     system,  the  -ext  option may be used to display additional
     information for each job.

  Reduced Format (without -f and -F)
     Following the header line a line is  printed  for  each  job
     consisting of

     <B>o</B>  the job ID.

     <B>o</B>  the priority of the jobs as assigned to them via  the  -p
        option  to  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> or <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qalter.html">qalter(1)</A></B> determining the order of
        the pending jobs list.

     <B>o</B>  the name of the job.

     <B>o</B>  the user name of the job owner.

     <B>o</B>  the status of the job - one of d(eletion), t(ransfering),
        r(unning),    R(estarted),    s(uspended),   S(uspended),
        T(hreshold), w(aiting) or h(old).

        The state d(eletion) indicates that a  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qdel.html">qdel(1)</A></B>  has  been
        used  to  initiate job deletion. The states t(ransfering)
        and r(unning) indicate that a job is about to be executed
        or  is already executing, whereas the states s(uspended),
        S(uspended) and T(hreshold) show that an already  running
        jobs  has been suspended. The s(uspended) state is caused
        by suspending  the  job  via  the  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmod.html">qmod(1)</A></B>  command,  the
        S(uspended) state indicates that the queue containing the
        job is suspended and therefore the job is also  suspended
        and the T(hreshold) state shows that at least one suspend
        threshold of the corresponding queue  was  exceeded  (see
        <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>)  and  that the job has been suspended as a
        consequence. The state R(estarted) indicates that the job
        was  restarted.  This can be caused by a job migration or
        because of one of the reasons described in the -r section
        of the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> command.

        The states w(aiting) and h(old) only appear  for  pending
        jobs.  The h(old) state indicates that a job currently is
        not eligible for execution due to a hold  state  assigned
        to it via <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qhold.html">qhold(1)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qalter.html">qalter(1)</A></B> or the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> -h option or
        that the job is waiting for completion  of  the  jobs  to
        which  job dependencies have been assigned to the job via
        the -hold_jid option of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> or <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qalter.html">qalter(1)</A></B>.

     <B>o</B>  the submission or start time and date of the job.

     <B>o</B>  the  queue  the  job  is  assigned  to  (for  running  or
        suspended jobs only).

     <B>o</B>  the function of the running jobs (MASTER or SLAVE  -  the
        latter for parallel jobs only).

     <B>o</B>  the array job task id. Will be empty for non-array  jobs.
        See  the  -t option to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> and the -g above for addi-
        tional information.

     If the -t option is supplied, each job status line also con-
     tains

     <B>o</B>  the parallel task ID (do not confuse parallel tasks  with
        array job tasks),

     <B>o</B>  the status of the  parallel  task  -  one  of  r(unning),
        R(estarted),   s(uspended),   S(uspended),   T(hreshold),
        w(aiting), h(old), or x(exited).

     <B>o</B>  the cpu, memory, and I/O usage  (Grid  Engine  Enterprise
        Edition only),

     <B>o</B>  the exit status of the parallel task,

     <B>o</B>  and the failure code and message for the parallel task.

  Full Format (with -f and -F)
     Following the header line a section for each queue separated
     by  a horizontal line is provided. For each queue the infor-
     mation printed consists of
     <B>o</B>  the queue name,

     <B>o</B>  the  queue  type  -  one   of   B(atch),   I(nteractive),
        C(heckpointing),  P(arallel),  T(ransfer) or combinations
        thereof,

     <B>o</B>  the number of used and available job slots,

     <B>o</B>  the load average of the queue host,

     <B>o</B>  the architecture of the queue host and

     <B>o</B>  the state  of  the  queue  -  one  of  u(nknown)  if  the
        corresponding  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> cannot be contacted, a(larm),
        A(larm),     C(alendar      suspended),      s(uspended),
        S(ubordinate),  d(isabled), D(isabled), E(rror) or combi-
        nations thereof.

     If the state is a(larm) at least on of the  load  thresholds
     defined  in the <I>load</I>_<I>thresholds</I> list of the queue configura-
     tion  (see  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>)  is  currently  exceeded,   which
     prevents from scheduling further jobs to that queue.

     As opposed to this, the  state  A(larm)  indicates  that  at
     least  one  of  the  suspend  thresholds  of  the queue (see
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>) is currently exceeded. This  will  result  in
     jobs  running  in  that  queue  being successively suspended
     until no threshold is violated.

     The states s(uspended) and d(isabled)  can  be  assigned  to
     queues  and  released  via the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmod.html">qmod(1)</A></B> command. Suspending a
     queue will cause all jobs executing  in  that  queue  to  be
     suspended.

     The states D(isabled) and C(alendar suspended) indicate that
     the  queue  has been disabled or suspended automatically via
     the calendar facility of Grid Engine (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/calendar_conf.html">calendar_conf(5)</A></B>),
     while  the S(ubordinate) state indicates, that the queue has
     been  suspend  via  subordination  to  another  queue   (see
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B> for details). When suspending a queue (regard-
     less of the cause) all jobs  executing  in  that  queue  are
     suspended too.

     If an E(rror) state is displayed for a  queue,  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B>
     on  that  host was unable to locate the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_shepherd.html">sge_shepherd(8)</A></B> exe-
     cutable on that host in order to start a job.  Please  check
     the  error  logfile of that <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> for leads on how to
     resolve the problem. Please enable the queue afterwards  via
     the -c option of the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmod.html">qmod(1)</A></B> command manually.

     If the -F option was used, resource availability information
     is  printed  following  the  queue  status  line.  For  each
     resource (as selected in an option argument to -F or for all
     resources  if the option argument was omitted) a single line
     is displayed with the following format:

     <B>o</B>  a one letter specifier  indicating  whether  the  current
        resource availability value was dominated by either
        `g' - a cluster global,
        `h' - a host total or
        `q' - a queue related resource consumption.

     <B>o</B>  a second one letter specifier indicating the  source  for
        the current resource availability value, being one of
        `l' - a load value reported for the resource,
        `L' - a load value for the resource  after  administrator
        defined load scaling has been applied,
        `c' - availability derived from the consumable  resources
        facility (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complexes.html">complexes(5)</A></B>),
        `v' -  a  default  complexes  configuration  value  never
        overwritten by a load report or a consumable update or
        `f' - a fixed  availability  definition  derived  from  a
        non-consumable  complex  attribute  or  a  fixed resource
        limit.

     <B>o</B>  after a colon the name of the resource on which  informa-
        tion is displayed.

     <B>o</B>  after an equal sign  the  current  resource  availability
        value.

     The displayed availability values and the sources from which
     they  derive  are  always the minimum values of all possible
     combinations.  Hence,  for  example,  a  line  of  the  form
     "qf:h_vmem=4G"  indicates  that a queue currently has a max-
     imum availability in virtual memory  of  4  Gigabyte,  where
     this  value  is  a fixed value (e.g. a resource limit in the
     queue configuration) and it is  queue  dominated,  i.e.  the
     host  in  total  may have more virtual memory available than
     this, but the queue doesn't allow  for  more.  Contrarily  a
     line  "hl:h_vmem=4G" would also indicate an upper bound of 4
     Gigabyte virtual memory availability, but the limit would be
     derived  from  a load value currently reported for the host.
     So while the queue might allow for jobs with higher  virtual
     memory requirements, the host on which this particular queue
     resides currently only has 4 Gigabyte available.

     If the -alarm option was used, information  about  resources
     is displayed, that violate load or suspend thresholds.
     The same format as with the -F option is used with following
     extensions:

     <B>o</B>  the line starts with the keyword `alarm'

     <B>o</B>  appended to the resource value is the type and  value  of
        the appropriate threshold

     After the queue status line (in case of -f) or the  resource
     availability  information  (in  case of -F) a single line is
     printed for each job running currently in this  queue.  Each
     job status line contains

     <B>o</B>  the job ID,

     <B>o</B>  the job name,

     <B>o</B>  the job owner name,

     <B>o</B>  the status of the job - one of t(ransfering),  r(unning),
        R(estarted), s(uspended), S(uspended) or T(hreshold) (see
        the Reduced Format section for detailed information),

     <B>o</B>  the start date and time and the function of the job (MAS-
        TER or SLAVE - only meaningful in case of a parallel job)
        and

     <B>o</B>  the priority of the jobs.

     If the -t option is supplied, each job status line also con-
     tains

     <B>o</B>  the task ID,

     <B>o</B>  the status of the task - one of  r(unning),  R(estarted),
        s(uspended), S(uspended), T(hreshold), w(aiting), h(old),
        or x(exited) (see the Reduced Format section for detailed
        information),

     <B>o</B>  the cpu, memory, and I/O usage  (Grid  Engine  Enterprise
        Edition only),

     <B>o</B>  the exit status of the task,

     <B>o</B>  and the failure code and message for the task.

     Following the list of queue sections a <I>PENDING</I> <I>JOBS</I> list may
     be  printed in case jobs are waiting for being assigned to a
     queue.  A status line for  each  waiting  job  is  displayed
     being  similar  to the one for the running jobs. The differ-
     ences are that the status  for  the  jobs  is  w(aiting)  or
     h(old),  that  the  submit time and date is shown instead of
     the start time and that no function  is  displayed  for  the
     jobs.

     In very rare cases, e.g. if <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> starts up from an
     inconsistent state in the job or queue spool files or if the
     clean queue (-cq) option of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B> is used,  <I>qstat</I>  cannot
     assign jobs to either the running or pending jobs section of
     the output. In this case as job status inconsistency (e.g. a
     job has a running status but is not assigned to a queue) has
     been detected. Such jobs are printed in an <I>ERROR</I>  <I>JOBS</I>  sec-
     tion  at  the very end of the output. The ERROR JOBS section
     should disappear upon  restart  of  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>.   Please
     contact  your Grid Engine support representative if you feel
     uncertain about the cause or effects of such jobs.

  Expanded Format (with -r)
     If the -r option was specified together with <I>qstat</I>, the fol-
     lowing information for each displayed job is printed (a sin-
     gle line for each of the following job characteristics):

     <B>o</B>  The job and master queue name.

     <B>o</B>  The hard and soft resource requirements  of  the  job  as
        specified with the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> -l option.

     <B>o</B>  The requested parallel environment including the  desired
        queue slot range (see -pe option of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>).

     <B>o</B>  The requested checkpointing environment of the  job  (see
        the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> -ckpt option).

     <B>o</B>  In case of running jobs, the granted parallel environment
        with the granted number of queue slots.

ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
     SGE_ROOT       Specifies the location  of  the  Grid  Engine
