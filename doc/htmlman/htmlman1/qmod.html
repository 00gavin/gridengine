NAME
     qmod - modify a Grid Engine queue

SYNTAX
     qmod [ options ] [ job/task_id_list | queue_list ]

DESCRIPTION
     <I>Qmod</I> enables users classified as <I>owners</I>  (see  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>
     for  details)  of  a workstation to modify the state of Grid
     Engine queues for his/her machine as well as  the  state  of
     his/her  own  jobs.   A manager/operator or root can execute
     <I>qmod</I> for any queue and job in a cluster.

OPTIONS
     -c   Clears the error state of the specified queue(s).

     -d   Disables  the  queue(s),  i.e.  no  further  jobs   are
          dispatched  to  disabled queues while jobs already exe-
          cuting in these queues are allowed to finish.

          (Is the successor of the CODINE version 3 -soc option.)

     -e   Enables the queue(s).

          (Is  the  successor  of  the  CODINE  version  3  -xsoc
          option.)

     -f   Force the modification action for the queue despite the
          apparent  current  state of the queue. For example if a
          queue appears to be suspended  but  the  job  execution
          seems to be continuing the manager/operator can force a
          suspend operation which will  send  a  SIGSTOP  to  the
          jobs.  In any case, the queue or job status will be set
          even if the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B>  controlling  the  queues/jobs
          cannot    be    reached.    Requires   manager/operator
          privileges.

     -help
          Prints a listing of all options.

     -s   If applied to queues, suspends the queues and any  jobs
          which  might  be  active.  If  applied to running jobs,
          suspends the jobs. If a job is  both  suspended  expli-
          citly  and  via  suspension  of  its queue, a following
          unsuspend of the queue will not release the  suspension
          state on the job.

     -us  If applied to queues, unsuspends  the  queues  and  any
          jobs  which  might  be  active.  If  applied  to  jobs,
          unsuspends the jobs. If a job is both suspended  expli-
          citly  and  via  suspension  of  its queue, a following
          unsuspend of the queue will not release the  suspension
          state on the job.

     -verify
          performs no modifications but just prints what would be
          done if -verify was not present.

     job/task_id_list | queue_list
          The jobs or queues  upon  which  <I>qmod</I>  is  supposed  to
          operate.  The  job/task_id_list  is specified by one of
          the following forms:

              <I>job</I>_<I>id</I>[.<I>task</I>_<I>range</I>][,<I>job</I>_<I>id</I>[.<I>task</I>_<I>range</I>],...]
              <I>job</I>_<I>id</I>[.<I>task</I>_<I>range</I>][ <I>job</I>_<I>id</I>[.<I>task</I>_<I>range</I>] ...]

          If present, the <I>task</I>_<I>range</I> restricts the effect of  the
          <I>qmod</I> operation to the job array task range specified as
          suffix to the job id (see the -t option to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>  for
          further details on job arrays).

          The task range specifier has  the  form  n[-m[:s]][,n[-
          m[:s]], ...] or n[-m[:s]][ n[-m[:s]] ...] and thus con-
          sists of a comma  or  blank  separated  list  of  range
          specifiers  n[-m[:s]].  The  ranges are concatenated to
          the complete task id range. Each range may be a  single
          number,  a simple range of the form n-m or a range with
          a step size.

ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
     SGE_ROOT       Specifies the location  of  the  Grid  Engine
                    standard configuration files.

     SGE_CELL       If set, specifies  the  default  Grid  Engine
                    cell. To address a Grid Engine cell <I>qmod</I> uses
                    (in the order of precedence):

                         The name of the cell  specified  in  the
                         environment  variable SGE_CELL, if it is
                         set.

                         The  name  of  the  default  cell,  i.e.
                         default.


     SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL
                    If  set,  specifies  that  debug  information
                    should  be written to stderr. In addition the
                    level of detail in which debug information is
                    generated is defined.

     COMMD_PORT     If set,  specifies  the  tcp  port  on  which
                    <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_commd.html">sge_commd(8)</A></B>  is  expected to listen for com-
                    munication requests.  Most installations will
                    use  a  services  map entry instead to define
                    that port.

     COMMD_HOST     If set, specifies the host on which the  par-
                    ticular  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_commd.html">sge_commd(8)</A></B>  to  be  used  for Grid
                    Engine  communication  of  the  <I>qmod</I>   client
                    resides.  Per default the local host is used.
