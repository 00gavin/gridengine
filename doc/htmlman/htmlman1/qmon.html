NAME
     qmon - X-Windows OSF/Motif graphical  user's  interface  for
     Grid Engine

SYNTAX
     qmon [options]

DESCRIPTION
     <I>Qmon</I> allows administrators and users to manipulate the  Grid
     Engine  system  from an X-Window environment.  <I>Qmon</I> provides
     various dialogues linked together  in  multiple  ways.   For
     each   task  the  user  wishes  to  accomplish  via  <I>qmon</I>  a
     corresponding dialogue is provided. There are multiple  ways
     to address the proper dialogue for a certain task:

     <B>o</B>  The <I>qmon</I> main window that comes up first on start-up con-
        tains  icon buttons for all major administrative and user
        tasks. A functionality tooltip is displayed when pointing
        at the different icons.

     <B>o</B>  A Task pulldown menu button appears in the <I>qmon</I> main win-
        dow  menu  bar.  Clicking on it opens a list of available
        tasks. Selecting one  of  them  opens  the  corresponding
        dialogue.

     <B>o</B>  The Task pulldown menu also contains the key accelerators
        which  can  be used to invoke the task dialogues directly
        from  the  main  window  by  pressing  a  certain  button
        sequence on the keyboard.

     <B>o</B>  While navigating  through  a  certain  dialogue  and  its
        dialogue  subhierarchy,  links  to  other dialogues occur
        whenever a connection between both dialogues is  obvious.
        Pushing  the buttons that identify the links opens up the
        other dialogues.

OPTIONS
     The supported options are the standard X Toolkit options  as
     described  in  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/X.html">X(1)</A></B>  section Options. Furthermore, <I>qmon</I> sup-
     ports:

     -cmap
          Installs a private color map for <I>qmon</I>.  This  is  some-
          times  useful  if other applications have already allo-
          cated lots of colors and  if  <I>qmon</I>,  therefore,  prints
          corresponding error messages. Note, however, that using
          a private color map will result in color  map  switches
          whenever you enter or leave <I>qmon</I> windows.

     -fontFamily {big|medium|small}
          Notifies <I>qmon</I> to use different sized font families  for
          different resolution sizes.

     -help
          Displays usage information.

     -nologo
          Startup without logo.

DIALOGUES
  Job Control
     The Job Control dialogue  provides  a  folder  of  tabulated
     lists  of  the  still pending jobs, already running jobs and
     recently finished jobs. The  dialogue  allows  for  detailed
     information  on  the  jobs  as  well as for the deletion and
     suspension of jobs being selected. In addition the job  con-
     trol  dialogue  offers links to the Submit dialogue in order
     to submit new jobs or to change attributes of  pending  jobs
     (Qalter  button).  The shown displayed fields in the tabular
     display and the jobs displayed can be customized by pressing
     the Customize button. This customization can be saved to the
     ~/.<I>qmon</I>_<I>preferences</I> file and is used on  following  startups
     for the initial configuration of the Job Control dialogue.


  Queue Control
     The Queue Control dialogue with its  sub-dialogue  hierarchy
     enables  the  user  to control the status of the Grid Engine
     queues being actually configured in the  system  and  allows
     the  administrator  to add new queues or to modify or delete
     already existing ones. Each icon button  in  the  top  level
     Queue  Control  dialogue window represents a configured Grid
     Engine queue.  The icon symbols, the coloring and  the  text
     on  the  buttons  informs about the architecture, the status
     and some basic attributes of  the  queues.   The  top  level
     dialogue  also  allows  for deleting those queues previously
     selected. Queues are selected  by  clicking  with  the  left
     mouse  button  on  the icons or into a rectangular area sur-
     rounding the buttons.

     By pushing the Add or Modify button or using a  pop-up  menu
     that  is  raised when clicking the right mouse button in the
     icon window of the top level Queue Control dialogue, a  sub-
     dialogue  for  configuring  Grid  Engine queues is opened. A
     queue needs to be selected to use the modify operation.  The
     configuration  sub-dialogue  allows  for  definition  of the
     queue and host name or displays the corresponding  names  in
     case  of  a modification. The queue configuration parameters
     (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>) are subdivided in  different  categories
     (General  Configuration,  Execution  Methods, Checkpointing,
     Load/Suspend Thresholds,  Limits,  Complexes,  User  Access,
     Project  Access  (only  for Grid Engine Enterprise Edition),
     Subordinate Queues, Owners) which are selectable by the  tab
     widget  area presented in the lower region of the queue con-
     figuration  sub-dialogue.  The  administrator   may   select
     default  values  from  already configured queues (Clone but-
     ton).  By  pushing  the  Ok  button,  the  definitions   are
     registered  with <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>.  The Queue Control dialogue
     can be customized in a similar way as the Job Control dialo-
     gue.   The   settings   applied   here  are  also  saved  in
     ~/.<I>qmon</I>_<I>preferences</I>.

  Submit
     The Job Submission dialogue serves for submitting batch  and
     interactive  jobs  and  is also invoked when changing attri-
     butes  of  pending  jobs  from  the  Job  Control   dialogue
     explained above (Qalter button). To toggle between batch and
     interactive jobs please use the Batch/Interactive button  at
     the  top  of  the button column on the right side of the Job
     Submission screen.

     The  dialogue  consists  of  a  folder  containing  two  job
     preparation  dialogue pages.The most frequently used parame-
     ters in the course of a job submission are  offered  on  the
     General  page.  A  job  script  has to be defined, all other
     fields are optional. If the job demands for specification of
     advanced  requirements,  the  Advanced  tab  can  be used to
     switch to an enhanced parameter display.

     If resource requirements are  mandatory  for  the  job,  the
     Request  Resources  icon button has to be used to pop up the
     Requested Resources sub-dialogue. This  sub-dialogue  allows
     for  selection  of the required resources of the job and for
     definition of the quantities in which this resources are  to
     be  provided.  The  Available  Resources  are constituted by
     those complex attributes  being  declared  <I>requestable</I>  (see
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html">complex(5)</A></B>  for  details). Resource requirements can be made
     Hard, i.e. they must be met before a job can be started in a
     queue,  or  Soft,  i.e.  they are granted on an as available
     basis.

     Closing the Requested Resources sub-dialogue with  the  done
     button  books the specified requirement for the job. Pushing
     the Submit button on the top level Submit  dialogue  submits
     the job.

  Complex Config
     The Complex Config allows the administrator to add new  com-
     plexes  or  to  modify  or  delete  existing  ones (see <I>com-</I>
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/plex.html">plex(5)</A></B>).  The dialogue offers  a  selection  list  for  the
     existing complexes and displays the configuration of the one
     being selected. By pushing the Delete button,  the  selected
     complex  is  deleted  from  the  configuration.  Pushing the
     Add/Modify button will open a complex  configuration  dialo-
     gue,  which allows to create new complexes or which provides
     the means to change the existing ones. If a new  complex  is
     to  be  created,  a name must be defined for it. The name of
     the complex to be modified is displayed  in  the  same  text
     input  filed in case of a modify operation. The complex con-
     figuration dialogue provides a tabulated list of the complex
     entries  and  an  input region for the declaration of new or
     modified entries. The Add button updates the tabulated  list
     with  the  new  or changed entry and the Ok button registers
     the additional or modified complex with <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>.

  Host Config
     Three types of host lists can be  maintained  via  the  Host
     Config dialogue:

          Administration Hosts
          Submit Hosts
          Execution Hosts

     The host list to be manipulated is selected via clicking  at
     one  of  the  tabs named correspondingly. The first two host
     lists only provide for adding or deleting  entries,  thereby
     allowing  administrative  or submit permission for the hosts
     on the lists, or denying  it  otherwise  respectively.   The
     execution  host list entries in addition provide the ability
     to define scaling factors for the load  sensors,  consumable
     complex  attributes  and  access attributes (access, xaccess
     and projects, xprojects for Grid Engine  Enterprise  Edition
     mode  only)  as  described  in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html">complex(5)</A></B>.  In a Grid Engine
     Enterprise Edition system CPU, memory and I/O usage reported
     for  running jobs can be scaled in addition and the relative
     performance of a host can be define with the Resource  Capa-
     bility Factor (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/host_conf.html">host_conf(5)</A></B>).

  Cluster Config
     This dialogue maintains the cluster global configuration  as
     well  as  host specific derivatives (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B>).  When
     opened, the dialogue displays a selection list for all hosts
     which  have a configuration assigned. The special name "glo-
     bal" refers to the cluster global configuration. By  pushing
     the Add/Modify button a sub-dialogue is opened, which allows
     for modification of  the  cluster  configuration.  For  host
     specific  configurations  the  'global' host specific confi-
     guration fields are set insensitive  and  only  the  allowed
     parameters can be manipulated.

  Scheduler Config
     The Scheduler Configuration dialogue provides the  means  to
     change  the  behavior  of  the  Grid Engine scheduler daemon
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_schedd.html">sge_schedd(8)</A></B>.  The dialogue contains a  representation  for
     all  scheduler  configuration  parameters  as  described  in
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sched_conf.html">sched_conf(5)</A></B>.  It is subdivided in the two sections General
     Parameters  and  Load  Adjustments which can be selected via
     the corresponding tabs.  The Ok button registers any changes
     with <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>.

  Calendar Config
     The Calendar Config allows  the  administrator  to  add  new
     calendars   or  to  modify  or  delete  existing  ones  (see
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/calendar_conf.html">calendar_conf(5)</A></B>).  The dialogue offers a selection list for
     the existing calendars and displays the configuration of the
     one being  selected.  By  pushing  the  Delete  button,  the
     selected calendar is deleted from the configuration. Pushing
     the Add/Modify button will  open  a  calendar  configuration
     dialogue, which allows to create new calendars or which pro-
     vides the means to change the existing ones. The  Ok  button
     registers   the   additional   or   modified  calendar  with
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>.

  User Config
     User permissions are controlled via the User  Config  dialo-
     gue.   The  tab  widget  in the left section of the dialogue
     allows for selecting between

          Configuration of Manager accounts.
          Configuration of Operator accounts.
          Definition of Usersets.
          Definition of User accounts (Grid Engine Enterprise Edition mode only).

     Those user accounts added to the list of manager or operator
     accounts  are  given permission to act as managers or opera-
     tors respectively when accessing Grid Engine under their own
     account.

     The userset lists are used together with the user_lists  and
     xuser_lists  host,  queue, project and cluster configuration
     parameters (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/project.html">project(5)</A></B>  and  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B>)
     to  control access of users to hosts, queues, projects (only
     available in a Grid Engine Enterprise  Edition  system)  and
     the  entire cluster.  A userset is just a collection of user
     names and UNIX group names. Group names  are  identified  by
     prefixing them with a "@" sign. The already defined usersets
     are displayed in a selection list. These lists can be  modi-
     fied  and new lists can be created using the Userset defini-
     tion dialogue.

     In a Grid Engine Enterprise Edition system usersets  can  be
     used  as  Access  List  (equivalent to their usage in a Grid
     Engine system) and/or as  Department  required  for  the  so
     called  Functional  Policy  and  Override Policy (see Ticket
     Config below).

     A Grid Engine Enterprise Edition system also requires adding
     accounts  having access to the system as entries to the Grid
     Engine Enterprise Edition user database (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/user.html">user(5)</A></B>),  This
     can be done with the User sub-dialogue.

     The Tickets button in the button list on the right  side  of
     the  dialogue  opens the Ticket Config dialogue (see below).
     This is also only available in a Grid Engine Enterprise Edi-
     tion system.

  PE Config
     Parallel environment (PE) interfaces can be configured  with
     this  dialogue.  PE interfaces are necessary to describe the
     way how parallel programming environments like PVM (Parallel
     Virtual  Machine), MPI (Message Passing Interface) or shared
     memory parallel systems are to be instantiated and to impose
     access  restrictions  onto  the  PEs.  When  the dialogue is
     opened a list of the already  configured  PEs  is  displayed
     together  with  the current configuration (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_pe.html">sge_pe(5)</A></B>) of
     the selected PE interface.  To add new PE interfaces  or  to
     modify  existing  ones, an Add and a Modify button is avail-
     able which opens a PE interface configuration  sub-dialogue.
     After  applying  the  changes and quitting this sub-dialogue
     with the OK button, the new  or  modified  PE  interface  is
     registered with <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>.

  Checkpoint Config
     Checkpointing environment interfaces can be configured  with
     this  dialogue.  Checkpointing environments are necessary to
     describe the attributes which  the  different  checkpointing
     methods  and  their  derivatives on various operating system
     platforms supported by Grid Engine have. When  the  dialogue
     is  opened  a  list  of the already configured checkpointing
     environments is displayed together with the  current  confi-
     guration  (see  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/checkpoint.html">checkpoint(5)</A></B>) of the selected checkpointing
     environment. To add  new  checkpointing  environment  or  to
     modify  existing  ones, an Add and a Modify button is avail-
     able which opens a checkpointing  environment  configuration
     sub-dialogue.  After  applying the changes and quitting this
     sub-dialogue with the OK button, the new or modified  check-
     pointing environment is registered with <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>.

  Ticket Conf
     This dialogue offers an  overview  and  editing  screen  for
     allocating  tickets to the share-based, functional and over-
     ride scheduling policies. It is only supported in case of  a
     Grid  Engine  Enterprise Edition system. It is not available
     for Grid Engine systems.

     The Deadline Job button opens the User  Conf  dialogue  box.
     Please  change  to  the  Userset sub-dialogue and select the
     userset named "deadlineusers".  Only users of  this  userset
     may submit deadline jobs.

     The Share Tree Policy button opens the dialogue for creating
     and  editing  the  Grid Engine Enterprise Edition share tree
     (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/share_tree.html">share_tree(5)</A></B> and <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/schedd_conf.html">schedd_conf(5)</A></B> for a  description  of
     the configuration parameters).
     The Functional Policy button opens the dialogue for creating
     and  editing  the  allocation  of the functional shares (see
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sched_conf.html">sched_conf(5)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/access_list.html">access_list(5)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/project.html">project(5)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B> and
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/user.html">user(5)</A></B>  for  a  description of the different types of func-
     tional shares and the configurable weighting parameters).

     The Override Policy button opens the dialogue  for  creating
     and   editing   the  allocation  of  override  tickets  (see
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/access_list.html">access_list(5)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/project.html">project(5)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B> and <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/user.html">user(5)</A></B> for  a
     description of the different types of override tickets).

  Project Conf
     This button opens a dialogue for creating  projects.  It  is
     only  supported  in case of a Grid Engine Enterprise Edition
     system. It is not available for Grid Engine systems.
     The dialogue offers a selection list for the  existing  pro-
     jects  and  displays  the  configuration  of  the  one being
     selected. By pushing the Delete button, the selected project
     is  deleted  from  the configuration. Pushing the Add/Modify
     button will open a  project  configuration  dialogue,  which
     allows to create new projects or which provides the means to
     change the existing ones. Project configuration  in  essence
     means  giving  or  denying  access to a project for usersets
     (see User Conf above as well as <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/project.html">project(5)</A></B>).  The Ok  button
     registers   the   additional   or   modified   project  with
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>.

  Browser
     The Object Browser dialogue's purpose is manifold: First  of
     all,  Grid  Engine and <I>qmon</I> messages such as notification of
     error or success concerning a previously taken action can be
     displayed  in  the dialogue's output window.  Also the stan-
     dard output and the standard error output  of  <I>qmon</I>  can  be
     diverted to the Object Browser output window.

     Additionally the Object Browser can be used to display  con-
     tinuous  information  about Grid Engine objects as the mouse
     pointer moves over their representation as  icons  or  table
     entries in other <I>qmon</I> dialogues. Currently, only the display
     of the configuration of  two  Grid  Engine  objects  in  two
     separate dialogues is supported:

     <B>o</B>  Queue configurations are displayed as soon as  the  mouse
        pointer  enters  a queue icon in the top level Queue Con-
        trol dialogue (see above). This facility is activated  by
        pushing the Queue button in the Object Browser dialogue.

     <B>o</B>  Detailed job information is printed as soon as  the  user
        moves  the  mouse  pointer over a line in the Job Control
        dialogue (see above) being assigned to a running or pend-
        ing job.

     <B>o</B>  Additionally job scheduling information is  displayed  in
        the browser if the Why ? button in the Job Control dialo-
        gue is pressed. In this  case  the  Browser  dialogue  is
        opened  implicitly and any scheduling related information
        is displayed.

  Exit
     The Exit icon button is not linked with a dialogue. Its sole
     purpose  is  to  close all active <I>qmon</I> dialogues and to exit
     the application.

RESOURCES
     The available resources, their meaning and the syntax to  be
     followed  in  order  to  modify  them  are  described in the
     default <I>qmon</I> resource file (see the section Files below  for
     the location of the resource file).

ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
     SGE_ROOT       Specifies the location  of  the  Grid  Engine
                    standard configuration files.

     SGE_CELL       If set, specifies  the  default  Grid  Engine
                    cell. To address a Grid Engine cell <I>qmon</I> uses
                    (in the order of precedence):

                         The name of the cell  specified  in  the
                         environment  variable SGE_CELL, if it is
                         set.

                         The  name  of  the  default  cell,  i.e.
                         default.


     SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL
                    If  set,  specifies  that  debug  information
                    should  be written to stderr. In addition the
                    level of detail in which debug information is
                    generated is defined.

     COMMD_PORT     If set,  specifies  the  tcp  port  on  which
                    <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_commd.html">sge_commd(8)</A></B>  is  expected to listen for com-
                    munication requests.  Most installations will
                    use  a  services  map entry instead to define
                    that port.

     COMMD_HOST     If set, specifies the host on which the  par-
                    ticular  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_commd.html">sge_commd(8)</A></B>  to  be  used  for Grid
                    Engine  communication  of  the  <I>qmon</I>   client
                    resides.  Per default the local host is used.

RESTRICTIONS
     If the line to be entered in an  editing  window  is  longer
     than  the  width  of the window, then the text just runs off
     the end of the window.
