NAME
     qdel - delete Grid Engine jobs from queues

SYNTAX
     qdel [ -f ] [ -help ] [ -verify ] [ job/task_id_list ]

     qdel [ -f ] [ -help ] [ -verify ] -u user_list | -uall

DESCRIPTION
     <I>Qdel</I> provides a means for a user/operator/manager to  delete
     one  or  more  jobs. <I>Qdel</I> deletes jobs in the order in which
     their job identifiers are presented.

OPTIONS
     -f   Force action for running jobs. The job(s)  are  deleted
          from the list of jobs registered at <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> even
          if the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> controlling  the  job(s)  does  not
          respond to the delete request sent by <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>.

     Users which are neither Grid Engine managers  nor  operators
     can only use the -f option (for their own jobs) if the clus-
     ter configuration entry  qmaster_params  contains  the  flag
     ENABLE_FORCED_QDEL (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B>).  However, behavior for
     administrative and non-administrative  users  differs.  Jobs
     are  deleted  from  the  Grid Engine database immediately in
     case of administrators. Otherwise,  a  regular  deletion  is
     attempted  first  and a forced cancellation is only executed
     if the regular deletion was unsuccessful.

     -help
          Prints a listing of all options.

     -u username,... | -uall
          Deletes only those jobs which were submitted  by  users
          specified in the list of usernames.  For managers it is
          possible to use the qdel -uall command  to  delete  all
          jobs of all users.

          If you use the -u or -uall switch it is be permitted to
          specify a additional <I>job</I>/<I>task</I>_<I>id</I>_<I>list</I>.

     -verify
          performs no modifications but just prints what would be
          done if -verify was not present.

     job/task_id_list
          Specified by the following form:

              <I>job</I>_<I>id</I>[.<I>task</I>_<I>range</I>][ <I>job</I>_<I>id</I>[.<I>task</I>_<I>range</I>] ...]

          If present, the <I>task</I>_<I>range</I> restricts the effect of  the
          <I>qdel</I> operation to the array job task range specified as
          suffix to the job id (see the -t option to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>  for
          further details on array jobs).

          The task range specifier has the  form  n[-m[:s]].  The
          range  may  be a single number, a  simple range  of the
          form n-m or a range with a step size.

          Instead of job/task_id_list it is possible to  use  the
          keyword 'all' to modify all jobs of the current user.

ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
     SGE_ROOT       Specifies the location  of  the  Grid  Engine
                    standard configuration files.

     SGE_CELL       If set, specifies  the  default  Grid  Engine
                    cell. To address a Grid Engine cell <I>qdel</I> uses
                    (in the order of precedence):

                         The name of the cell  specified  in  the
                         environment  variable SGE_CELL, if it is
                         set.

                         The  name  of  the  default  cell,  i.e.
                         default.


     SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL
                    If  set,  specifies  that  debug  information
                    should  be written to stderr. In addition the
                    level of detail in which debug information is
                    generated is defined.

     COMMD_PORT     If set,  specifies  the  tcp  port  on  which
                    <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_commd.html">sge_commd(8)</A></B>  is  expected to listen for com-
                    munication requests.  Most installations will
                    use  a  services  map entry instead to define
                    that port.

     COMMD_HOST     If set, specifies the host on which the  par-
                    ticular  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_commd.html">sge_commd(8)</A></B>  to  be  used  for Grid
                    Engine  communication  of  the  <I>qdel</I>   client
                    resides.  Per default the local host is used.

FILES
     &lt;<I>sge</I>_<I>root</I>&gt;/&lt;<I>cell</I>&gt;/<I>common</I>/<I>act</I>_<I>qmaster</I>
                     Grid Engine master host file
