DESCRIPTION
     <I>Qsub</I> submits batch jobs to the Grid Engine  queuing  system.
     Grid   Engine   supports  single  and  multiple  node  jobs.
     scriptfile contains the commands to be run by the job  using
     a  shell  (for  example, <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sh.html">sh(1)</A></B> or <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/csh.html">csh(1)</A></B>).  Arguments to the
     job script are given by script_args.  Grid Engine flags  may
     be  entered as arguments to <I>qsub</I> or as embedded flags in the
     scriptfile if the first two  characters  of  a  script  line
     either  match '#$' or are equal to the prefix string defined
     with the -C option described below.

     <I>Qsh</I> submits an interactive X-windows session to Grid Engine.
     An  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/xterm.html">xterm(1)</A></B>  is  brought up from the executing machine with
     the display directed either to the X-server indicated by the
     DISPLAY  environment  variable  or  as  specified  with  the
     -<I>display</I> <I>qsh</I> option. Interactive jobs are not spooled if  no
     resource  is  available  to  execute  them.  They are either
     dispatched to a suitable machine for  execution  immediately
     or  the  user  submitting  the  job  is notified by <I>qsh</I> that
     appropriate resources to execute the job are not  available.
     xterm_args are passed to the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/xterm.html">xterm(1)</A></B> executable.
     <I>Qlogin</I> is similar to <I>qsh</I> in that it submits  an  interactive
     job  to  the  queueing  system. It does not open an <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/xterm.html">xterm(1)</A></B>
     window on the X display, but uses the current  terminal  for
     user I/O. Usually, <I>qlogin</I> establishes a <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/telnet.html">telnet(1)</A></B> connection
     with the remote host, using standard client- and server-side
     commands.   These   commands  can  be  configured  with  the
     qlogin_daemon (server-side, Grid Engine <I>telnetd</I> if not  set,
     otherwise    something    like   /usr/sbin/in.telnetd)   and
     qlogin_command (client-side, Grid Engine <I>telnet</I> if not  set,
     otherwise  something like /usr/bin/telnet) parameters in the
     global and local configuration settings of <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B>.  The
     client  side command is automatically parameterized with the
     remote host name and port number to connect to (i.e. result-
     ing  in  an  invocation  like  /usr/bin/telnet  my_exec_host
     2442).  <I>Qlogin</I> is invoked exactly like <I>qsh</I> and its jobs  can
     only  run  on  INTERACTIVE  queues.  <I>Qlogin</I> jobs can only be
     used if the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> is running under the root account.

     <I>Qrsh</I> is similar to <I>qlogin</I> in that it submits an  interactive
     job  to the queuing system. It uses the current terminal for
     user I/O. Usually, <I>qrsh</I> establishes a <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/rsh.html">rsh(1)</A></B> connection with
     the remote host. If no command is given to <I>qrsh</I>, a <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/rlogin.html">rlogin(1)</A></B>
     session is established.  The server-side commands  used  can
     be  configured with the rsh_daemon and rlogin_daemon parame-
     ters in the  global  and  local  configuration  settings  of
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B>.   A Grid Engine <I>rshd</I> or <I>rlogind</I> is used, if the
     parameters  are  not  set  or   otherwise   something   like
     /usr/sbin/in.rshd  or  /usr/sbin/in.rlogind.  On the client-
     side, the rsh_command and rlogin_command parameters  can  be
     set  in  the  global  and  local  configuration  settings of
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B>.  If they  are  not  set,  special  Grid  Engine
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/rsh.html">rsh(1)</A></B> and <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/rlogin.html">rlogin(1)</A></B> binaries delivered with Grid Engine are
     used.  Use the cluster configuration parameters to integrate
     mechanisms  like  <I>ssh</I> or the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/rsh.html">rsh(1)</A></B> and <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/rlogin.html">rlogin(1)</A></B> facilities
     supplied with the operating system.

     <I>Qrsh</I> jobs can only run  in  INTERACTIVE  queues  unless  the
     option  -now no is used (see below).  They can only be used,
     if the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> is running under the root account.

     <I>Qrsh</I> provides an additional feature useful for the  integra-
     tion  with  interactive  tools  providing a specific command
     shell. If the environment variable QRSH_WRAPPER is set  when
     <I>qrsh</I>  is  invoked,  the  command  interpreter  pointed to by
     QRSH_WRAPPER will be executed to run <I>qrsh</I>  commands  instead
     of  the users login shell or any shell specified in the <I>qrsh</I>
     command-line.

     <I>Qalter</I> can be used to change the attributes of pending jobs.
     Once a job is executing, changes are no longer possible. For
     array jobs, for which a part of the tasks can be pending and
     another  part  can  be  running  (see  the -t option below),
     modifications with <I>qalter</I> only  affect  the  pending  tasks.
     <I>Qalter</I>  can change most of the characteristics of a job (see
     the corresponding statements in the OPTIONS section  below),
     including  those which were defined as embedded flags in the
     script file (see above).

     <I>Qresub</I> allows to create jobs as copies from existing pending
     or  running jobs. The copied jobs will have exactly the same
     attributes as the ones from which they are copied, but a new
     job  ID.  The only modification to the copied jobs supported
     by qresub is to assign a hold state with the -h option. This
     can  be  used to first copy a job and then change its attri-
     butes via <I>qalter</I>.

     For <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, and <I>qlogin</I> the  administrator  and  the
     user  may  define default request files (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_request.html">sge_request(5)</A></B>)
     which can contain any of the options described below.  If an
     option  in  a default request file is understood by <I>qsub</I> and
     <I>qlogin</I> but not by <I>qsh</I> the option is silently ignored if  <I>qsh</I>
     is  invoked.  Thus  you  can maintain shared default request
     files for both <I>qsub</I> and <I>qsh</I>.

     A cluster wide default request  file  may  be  placed  under
     $SGE_ROOT/$SGE_CELL/common/sge_request.      User    private
     default request files  are  processed  under  the  locations
     $HOME/.sge_request and $cwd/.sge_request. The working direc-
     tory local default request file has the highest  precedence,
     then  the  home  directory located file and then the cluster
     global file.  The  option  arguments,  the  embedded  script
     flags  and the options in the default request files are pro-
     cessed in the following order:

          left to right in the script line,
          left to right in the default request files,
          from top to bottom of the script file (<I>qsub</I> only),
          from top to bottom of default request files,
          from left to right of the command line.

     In other words, the command line can be used to override the
     embedded flags and the default request settings.  The embed-
     ded flags, however, will override the default settings.

     Note, that the -<I>clear</I> option can be used to discard any pre-
     vious settings at any time in a default request file, in the
     embedded script flags, or in a command-line option.  It  is,
     however, not available with <I>qalter</I>.

     The options described below can be requested either hard  or
     soft.   By  default,  all requests are considered hard until
     the -soft option (see below) is encountered.  The  hard/soft
     status  remains  in  effect until its counterpart is encoun-
     tered again.  If all the hard requests for a job  cannot  be
     met,  the  job  will not be scheduled.  Jobs which cannot be
     run at the present time remain spooled.

OPTIONS
     -@ optionfile
          Forces <I>qsub</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qsh</I>, or <I>qlogin</I> to  use  the  options
          contained in optionfile. The indicated file may contain
          all valid options. Comment lines are  starting  with  a
          "#" sign.

     -a date_time
          Available for <I>qsub</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          Defines or redefines the time and date at which  a  job
          is   eligible  for  execution.  Date_time  conforms  to
          [[CC]]YY]MMDDhhmm.[ss], where:

          CC  denotes the century in 2 digits.
          YY  denotes the year in 2 digits.
          MM  denotes the month in 2 digits.
          DD  denotes the day in 2 digits.
          hh  denotes the hour in 2 digits.
          mm  denotes the minute in 2 digits.
          ss  denotes the seconds in 2 digits (default 00).

          If any of the optional  date  fields  is  omitted,  the
          corresponding value of the current date is assumed.
          Usage of this option may cause  unexpected  results  if
          the clocks of the hosts in the Grid Engine pool are out
          of sync. Also, the proper behavior of this option  very
          much  depends on the correct setting of the appropriate
          timezone, e.g. in  the  TZ  environment  variable  (see
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/date.html">date(1)</A></B>  for  details),  when  the  Grid Engine daemons
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> and <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> are invoked.

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect
          after a restart or migration of the job, however.

     -ac variable[=value],...
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          Adds the given name/value pair(s) to the job's context.
          Value  may  be  omitted.  Grid Engine appends the given
          argument to the list of context variables for the  job.
          Multiple  -ac,  -dc, and -sc options may be given.  The
          order is important here.

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes.

     -A account_string
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          Identifies the account to which the  resource  consump-
          tion  of  the job should be charged. The account_string
          may be any arbitrary ASCII alphanumeric string but  may
          contain  no blank or separator characters. The underbar
          '_' is considered a non-separator. In  the  absence  of
          this  parameter  Grid  Engine  will  place  the default
          account string "sge" in the accounting  record  of  the
          job.

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes.

     -c occasion_specifier
          Available for <I>qsub</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          Defines or redefines whether the job should  be  check-
          pointed,  and  if  so,  under  what  circumstances. The
          specification of the checkpointing occasions with  this
          option overwrites the definitions of the <I>when</I> parameter
          in the checkpointing  environment  (see  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/checkpoint.html">checkpoint(5)</A></B>)
          referenced  by  the <I>qsub</I> -<I>ckpt</I> switch.  Possible values
          for occasion_specifier are

          n           no checkpoint is performed.
          s           checkpoint when batch server is shut down.
          m           checkpoint at minimum CPU interval.
          x           checkpoint when job gets suspended.
          &lt;interval&gt;  checkpoint in the specified time interval.

          The minimum CPU interval is defined in the queue confi-
          guration  (see  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B> for details).  &lt;interval&gt;
          has to be specified in the format hh:mm:ss.   The  max-
          imum of &lt;interval&gt; and the queue's minimum CPU interval
          is used if &lt;interval&gt; is specified.  This  is  done  to
          ensure  that a machine is not overloaded by checkpoints
          being generated too frequently.

     -ckpt ckpt_name
          Available for <I>qsub</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          Selects  the  checkpointing  environment  (see   <I>check-</I>
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/point.html">point(5)</A></B>)  to be used for a checkpointing the job. Also
          declares the job to be a checkpointing job.

     -clear
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, and <I>qlogin</I> only.

          Causes all elements of the job to be reset to the  ini-
          tial default status prior to applying any modifications
          (if any) appearing in this specific command.

     -cwd Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          Execute the job from  the  current  working  directory.
          This  switch  will activate Grid Engine's path aliasing
          facility, if the corresponding configuration files  are
          present (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_aliases.html">sge_aliases(5)</A></B>).

          In case of  <I>qalter</I>,  the  previous  definition  of  the
          current  working  directory  will  be  overwritten,  if
          <I>qalter</I> is executed from a different directory than  the
          preceding <I>qsub</I> or <I>qalter</I>.

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect
          after a restart or migration of the job, however.

     -C prefix_string
          Available for <I>qsub</I> only.

          <I>Prefix</I>_<I>string</I> defines the prefix that declares a direc-
          tive to <I>qsub</I> in the job's scriptfile. The prefix is not
          a job attribute, but affects the behavior of  <I>qsub</I>.  If
          the -C option is presented with the value of the direc-
          tive prefix as a null string, <I>qsub</I> will  not  scan  the
          scriptfile
          The directive prefix consists of two  ASCII  characters
          which when appearing in the first two bytes of a script
          line indicate that what follows is a Grid  Engine  com-
          mand (default is "#$").
          The user should be aware that changing the first delim-
          iter  character can produce unforeseen side effects. If
          the script file contains  anything  other  than  a  "#"
          character  in  the first byte position of the line, the
          shell processor for the job will reject  the  line  and
          may exit the job prematurely.
          If the -C option is present in the script file,  it  is
          ignored.

     -dc variable,...
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          Removes the given variable(s) from the  job's  context.
          Multiple  -ac,  -dc, and -sc options may be given.  The
          order is important here.

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes.

     -display display_specifier
          Available for <I>qsh</I> only.

          Directs <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/xterm.html">xterm(1)</A></B> to use display_specifier in  order  to
          contact the X server.

     -dl date_time
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I>  only.
          This  option is only supported in case of a Grid Engine
          Enterprise Edition system. It is not available for Grid
          Engine systems.
          Specifies   the    deadline    initiation    time    in
          [[CC]YY]DDhhmm[.SS]  format  (see -a option above). The
          deadline initiation time is the time at which  a  dead-
          line  job  has to reach top priority to be able to com-
          plete within a given deadline. Before the deadline ini-
          tiation  time  the  priority  of a deadline job will be
          raised steadily until it reaches the maximum as config-
          ured by the Grid Engine administrator.
          This option is applicable for users allowed  to  submit
          deadline jobs only.

     -e [hostname:]path,...
          Available for <I>qsub</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          Defines or redefines the path  used  for  the  standard
          error  stream  of  the  job. If the path constitutes an
          absolute path name, the error-path attribute of the job
          is set to its value including the hostname. If the path
          name is relative, Grid Engine expands path either  with
          the  current  working  directory  path in case the -cwd
          (see above) switch is also specified or with  the  home
          directory  path  otherwise. If hostname is present, the
          standard  error  stream  will  be  placed   under   the
          corresponding location if the job runs on the specified
          host.

          By default the file name for  standard  error  has  the
          form  <I>job</I>_<I>name</I>.e<I>job</I>_<I>id</I> and <I>job</I>_<I>name</I>.e<I>job</I>_<I>id</I>.task_id for
          array job tasks (see -t option below).

          If path is a directory, the standard  error  stream  of
          the job will be put in this directory under the default
          file name.  If the  pathname  contains  certain  pseudo
          environment  variables, their value will be expanded at
          runtime of the job and will be used to  constitute  the
          standard  error  stream path name. The following pseudo
          environment variables are supported currently:

          $HOME       home directory on execution machine
          $USER       user ID of job owner
          $JOB_ID     current job ID
          $JOB_NAME   current job name (see -N option)
          $HOSTNAME   name of the execution host
          $TASK_ID    array job task index number

          Alternatively to $HOME the tilde sign "~" can  be  used
          as common in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/csh.html">csh(1)</A></B> or <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/ksh.html">ksh(1)</A></B>.  Note, that the "~" sign
          also works in combination  with  user  names,  so  that
          "~&lt;user&gt;"  expands  to  the  home  directory of &lt;user&gt;.
          Using another user  ID  than  that  of  the  job  owner
          requires corresponding permissions, of course.

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect
          after a restart or migration of the job, however.

     -hard
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          Signifies that all resource requirements  following  in
          the  command line will be hard requirements and must be
          satisfied in full before a job can be scheduled.
          As Grid Engine scans the command line and  script  file
          for Grid Engine options and parameters it builds a list
          of resources required  by  a  job.  All  such  resource
          requests are considered as absolutely essential for the
          job to commence. If the -soft  option  (see  below)  is
          encountered   during   the   scan  then  all  following
          resources are designated  as  "soft  requirements"  for
          execution, or "nice-to-have, but not essential". If the
          -hard flag is encountered at a later stage of the scan,
          all  resource  requests  following it once again become
          "essential". The -hard and -soft options in effect  act
          as "toggles" during the scan.

     -h | -h {u|s|o|n|U|O|S}...
          Available for  <I>qsub</I>,  <I>qsh</I>,  <I>qrsh</I>,  <I>qlogin</I>,  <I>qalter</I>  and
          <I>qresub</I>.

          List of holds to place on the job.

          `u'  denotes a user hold.
          `s'  denotes a system hold.
          `o'  denotes a operator hold.
          `n'  denotes no hold.

          As long as any hold other than `n' is assigned  to  the
          job the job is not eligible for execution. Holds can be
          released via <I>qalter</I> and <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrls.html">qrls(1)</A></B>.   In  case  of  <I>qalter</I>
          this  is  supported  by the following additional option
          specifiers for the -h switch:

          `U'  removes a user hold.
          `S'  removes a system hold.
          `O'  removes a operator hold.

          Grid Engine managers can assign  and  remove  all  hold
          types, Grid Engine operators can assign and remove user
          and operator holds and users can only assign or  remove
          user holds.

          In the case of <I>qsub</I> only user holds can be placed on  a
          job and thus only the first form of the option with the
          -h switch alone is allowed.  As opposed to this, <I>qalter</I>
          requires the second form described above.

          An alternate means to assign hold is  provided  by  the
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qhold.html">qhold(1)</A></B> facility.

          If the job is a array job (see the  -t  option  below),
          all  tasks  specified  via  -t  are  affected by the -h
          operation simultaneously.

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect
          after a restart or migration of the job, however.

     -help
          Prints  a listing of all options.

     -hold_jid [job_id|job_name],...
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          Defines or redefines the job  dependency  list  of  the
          submitted job. A reference by job name is only accepted
          if the referenced job is owend by the same user as  the
          refering  job.  The  submitted  job is not eligible for
          execution  unless  all  jobs  referenced  in  the  coma
          separated  job  id  and/or job name list have completed
          successfully.

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect
          after a restart or migration of the job, however.

     -inherit
          Available only for <I>qrsh</I> and <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmake.html">qmake(1)</A></B>.

          <I>qrsh</I> allows to start a task  in  an  already  scheduled
          parallel job.  The option -inherit tells <I>qrsh</I> to read a
          job id from the environment variable JOB_ID  and  start
          the  specified  command  as  a task in this job. Please
          note that in this case, the hostname of the host  where
          the command shall be executed, must precede the command
          to execute; the syntax changes to

          qrsh -inherit [ other  options  ]  hostname  command  [
          command_args ]

          Note also, that  in  combination  with  -inherit,  most
          other  command  line options will be ignored.  Only the
          options -verbose, -v and -V will be interpreted.  As  a
          replacement to option -cwd please use -v PWD.

          Usually  a  task  should  have  the  same   environment
          (including   the  current  working  directory)  as  the
          corresponding job, so specifying the option  -V  should
          be suitable for most applications.

          <I>Note</I>: If in your system the commd port is  not  config-
          ured   as   service,   but   via  environment  variable
          COMMD_PORT, make sure that this variable is set in  the
          enviroment  when  calling  <I>qrsh</I>  or  <I>qmake</I>  with option
          -inherit.  If  you  call  <I>qrsh</I>  or  <I>qmake</I>  with  option
          -inherit  from  within  a job script, export COMMD_PORT
          with  the  submit  option  or   special   comment   "-v
          COMMD_PORT".

     -j y|n
          Available for <I>qsub</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          Specifies whether or not the standard error  stream  of
          the job is merged into the standard output stream.
          If both the -j y and the -e options are  present,  Grid
          Engine sets, but ignores the error-path attribute.

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect
          after a restart or migration of the job, however.

     -l resource=value,...
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          Launch the job in a Grid Engine queue meeting the given
          resource  request list.  In case of <I>qalter</I> the previous
          definition is replaced by the specified one.
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html">complex(5)</A></B> describes how a list of available  resources
          and  their  associated  valid  value  specifiers can be
          obtained.
          There may be multiple -l switches in a single  command.
          You  may request multiple -l options to be soft or hard
          both in the same command line. In case of a serial  job
          multiple  -l  switches  refine  the  definition for the
          sought queue.

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect
          after a restart or migration of the job, however.

     -m b|e|a|s|n,...
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.
          Defines or redefines under which circumstances mail  is
          to  be  sent  to  the job owner or to the users defined
          with the -M option described below.  The  option  argu-
          ments have the following meaning:

          `b'     Mail is sent at the beginning of the job.
          `e'     Mail is sent at the end of the job.
          `a'     Mail is sent when the job is aborted or
                  rescheduled.
          `s'     Mail is sent when the job is suspended.
          `n'     No mail is sent.

          Currently no mail is sent when a job is suspended.

          For <I>qsh</I> and <I>qlogin</I> mail at the beginning or end of  the
          job  is  suppressed when it is encountered in a default
          request file.

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing the b, e, and a option arguments
          even  while the job executes. The modification of the b
          option argument will only be in effect after a  restart
          or migration of the job, however.

     -M user[@host],...
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          Defines or redefines the list of  users  to  which  the
          server  that  executes the job has to send mail, if the
          server sends mail about the job.  Default  is  the  job
          owner at the originating host.

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes.

     -masterq queue,...
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I>.  Only
          meaningful  for  parallel  jobs, i.e. together with the
          -pe option.

          Defines or redefines a list of queues which may be used
          to  become  the so called <I>master</I> <I>queue</I> of this parallel
          job. The <I>master</I> <I>queue</I> is defined as the queue where the
          parallel  job is started. The other queues to which the
          parallel job spawns tasks are called <I>slave</I>  <I>queues</I>.   A
          parallel job only has one <I>master</I> <I>queue</I>.

          This parameter has all the  properties  of  a  resource
          request  and  will  be merged with requirements derived
          from the -l option described above.

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect
          after a restart or migration of the job, however.

     -notify
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          This flag, when set causes Grid Engine to  send  "warn-
          ing" signals to a running job prior to sending the sig-
          nals themselves. If a SIGSTOP is pending the  job  will
          receive  a  SIGUSR1 several seconds before the SIGSTOP.
          If a SIGKILL is pending the job will receive a  SIGUSR2
          several seconds before the SIGKILL.  The amount of time
          delay is controlled by the  notify  parameter  in  each
          queue configuration (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>).

          Note, that the Linux  operating  system  "misuses"  the
          user  signals  SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 in its current Posix
          thread implementation. You might not want  to  use  the
          -notify option if you are running threaded applications
          in your jobs under Linux.

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes.

     -now y[es]|n[o]
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qrsh</I>.

          -now y tries to start the job  immediately  or  not  at
          all.  The command returns 0 on success, or 1 on failure
          (also if the job could not be  scheduled  immediately).
          -now y is default for <I>qsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qrsh</I>
          With option -now n the job will be put into the pending
          queue,  if it cannot be executed immediately. -now n is
          default for <I>qsub</I>.

     -N name
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          The name of the job. The name can be any printable  set
          of characters, starting with an alphabetic character.
          If the -N option is not present Grid Engine assigns the
          name  of  the job script to the job after any directory
          pathname has been removed from the script-name. If  the
          script  is  read  from  standard  input  the  job  name
          defaults to STDIN.
          In case of <I>qsh</I> or <I>qlogin</I> and if the -N option is absent
          the string `INTERACT' is assigned to the job.

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes.

     -noshell
          Available only for <I>qrsh</I> with a commandline.
          Do not start the commandline given to <I>qrsh</I> in  a  users
          login shell but execute it without the wrapping shell.

          The option can be used to speed up  execution  as  some
          overhead  like the shell startup and sourcing the shell
          resource files is avoided.

          The option can only be used, if no shell specific  com-
          mandline  parsing  is required. If the commandline con-
          tains shell syntax like environment variable  substitu-
          tion  or  (back)  quoting, a shell must be started.  In
          this case either do not  use  the  -noshell  option  or
          include the shell call in the commandline.

          Example:
          qrsh echo '$HOSTNAME'
          Alternative call with the -noshell option
          qrsh -noshell /bin/tcsh -f -c 'echo $HOSTNAME'

     -nostdin
          Available only for <I>qrsh</I>.

          Suppress the input stream STDIN - <I>qrsh</I>  will  pass  the
          option  -n  to  the  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/rsh.html">rsh(1)</A></B> command. This is especially
          usefull, if multiple tasks  are  executed  in  parallel
          using  <I>qrsh</I>,  e.g.  in  a <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/make.html">make(1)</A></B> process - it would be
          undefined, which process would get the input.

     -o [hostname:]path,...
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          The path used for the standard  output  stream  of  the
          job.  The path is handled as described in the -e option
          for the standard error stream.

          By default the file name for standard  output  has  the
          form  <I>job</I>_<I>name</I>.o<I>job</I>_<I>id</I> and <I>job</I>_<I>name</I>.o<I>job</I>_<I>id</I>.task_id for
          array job tasks (see -t option below).

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect
          after a restart or migration of the job, however.

     -ot override_tickets
          Available for <I>qalter</I> only.  This option  is  only  sup-
          ported in case of a Grid Engine Enterprise Edition sys-
          tem. It is not available for Grid Engine systems.
          Changes the number of override tickets for  the  speci-
          fied job.  Requires manager/operator privileges.

     -P project_name
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I>  only.
          This  option is only supported in case of a Grid Engine
          Enterprise Edition system. It is not available for Grid
          Engine systems.
          Specifies the project to which this  job  is  assigned.
          The  administrator  needs to give permission to indivi-
          dual users to submit jobs to a specific  project.  (see
          -aprj option to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B>).

     -p priority
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          Defines or redefines the priority of the  job  relative
          to  other  jobs.   Priority  is an integer in the range
          -1023 to 1024.  The default priority value for the jobs
          is 0.

          In a Grid Engine system, users may  only  decrease  the
          priority  of  their  jobs.   Grid  Engine  managers and
          administrators may also increase the  priority  associ-
          ated  with  jobs. If a pending job has higher priority,
          it is earlier eligible for being dispatched by the Grid
          Engine  scheduler.  The  job  priority has no effect on
          running jobs in Grid Engine.

          In Grid Engine Enterprise  Edition,  the  job  priority
          influences  the  Share  Tree  Policy and the Functional
          Policy. It has no effect on the Deadline  and  Override
          Policies (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/share_tree.html">share_tree(5)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sched_conf.html">sched_conf(5)</A></B> and the <I>Grid</I>
          <I>Engine</I> <I>Enterprise</I> <I>Edition</I> <I>Installation</I> <I>and</I> for  further
          information  on  the  resource management policies sup-
          ported by Grid Engine Enterprise Edition).

          In case of the Share Tree Policy, users can  distribute
          the  tickets,  to  which  they  are currently entitled,
          among their jobs using  different  priorities  assigned
          via  -p.  If all jobs have the same priority value, the
          tickets are distributed evenly.  Jobs  receive  tickets
          relative to the different priorities otherwise. Priori-
          ties are treated like an additional level in the  share
          tree in the latter case.

          In connection with the Functional Policy, the  priority
          can  be  used  to weight jobs within the functional job
          category.  Again tickets are  distributed  relative  to
          any  uneven  priority distribution treated as a virtual
          share distribution level underneath the functional  job
          category.

          If both, the Share Tree and the Functional  Policy  are
          active,  the job priorities will have an effect in both
          policies and the tickets independently derived in  each
          of them are added up to the total number of tickets for
          each job.

     -pe parallel_environment n[-[m]]|[-]m,...
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          Parallel programming environment (PE)  to  instantiate.
          The  range  descriptor behind the PE name specifies the
          number of parallel processes to  be  run.  Grid  Engine
          will  allocate  the appropriate resources as available.
          The <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_pe.html">sge_pe(5)</A></B> manual page  contains  information  about
          the definition of PEs and about how to obtain a list of
          currently valid PEs.
          You can specify the PE  name   by  using  the  wildcard
          character  "*",  thus the request "pvm*" will match any
          parallel environment with  a  name  starting  with  the
          string "pvm".
          The range specification is a list of range  expressions
          of the form n-m (n as well as m being positive non-zero
          integer numbers), where m is an abbreviation  for  m-m,
          -m  is  a  short form for 1-m and n- is an abbreviation
          for n-infinity. The range specification is processed as
          follows:  The  largest  number  of  queues requested is
          checked first. If enough queues meeting  the  specified
          attribute  list  are  available, all are allocated. The
          next smaller number of queues is checked  next  and  so
          forth.
          If additional -l options are present, they restrict the
          set of eligible queues for the parallel job.

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect
          after a restart or migration of the job, however.

     -q queue,...
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I>.

          Defines or redefines a list of queues which may be used
          to execute this job. This parameter has all the proper-
          ties of a resource request  and  will  be  merged  with
          requirements  derived  from  the  -l  option  described
          above.

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect
          after a restart or migration of the job, however.

     -r y|n
          Available for <I>qsub</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          Identifies the ability of a job to be rerun or not.  If
          the  value  of  -r is 'y', rerun the job if the job was
          aborted without leaving a consistent exit  state  (this
          is  typically  the case if the node on which the job is
          running crashes).  If -r is 'n', do not rerun  the  job
          under any circumstances.
          Interactive jobs submitted with <I>qsh</I> or <I>qlogin</I>  are  not
          re-runable.

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes.

     -sc variable[=value],...
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          Sets the given name/value pairs as the  job's  context.
          Value  may  be  omitted. Grid Engine replaces the job's
          previously defined context with the one  given  as  the
          argument.   Multiple  -ac,  -dc, and -sc options may be
          given.  The order is important here.
          Contexts are a way to  dynamically  attach  and  remove
          meta-information  to  and from a job. The context vari-
          ables are not passed to the job's execution context  in
          its environment.

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes.

     -soft
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          Signifies that all resource requirements  following  in
          the  command  line will be soft requirements and are to
          be filled on an "as available" basis.
          As Grid Engine scans the command line and  script  file
          for Grid Engine options and parameters it builds a list
          of resources required  by  a  job.  All  such  resource
          requests are considered as absolutely essential for the
          job to commence. If the  -soft  option  is  encountered
          during the scan then all following resources are desig-
          nated as "soft requirements" for execution,  or  "nice-
          to-have,  but  not  essential".  If the -hard flag (see
          above) is encountered at a later stage of the scan, all
          resource   requests  following  it  once  again  become
          "essential". The -hard and -soft options in effect  act
          as "toggles" during the scan.

     -S [host:]pathname,...
          Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I>.

          Specifies the interpreting shell for the job. Only  one
          pathname  component  without  a host specifier is valid
          and only one path name for a  given  host  is  allowed.
          Shell paths with host assignments define the interpret-
          ing shell for the job if  the  host  is  the  execution
          host. The shell path without host specification is used
          if the execution host matches none of the hosts in  the
          list.

          Furthermore,  the  pathname  can  be  constructed  with
          pseudo  environment  variables  as described for the -e
          option above.

          In the case of <I>qsh</I> the specified shell path is used  to
          execute  the  corresponding  command interpreter in the
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/xterm.html">xterm(1)</A></B> (via its -<I>e</I> option) started on behalf  of  the
          interactive job.

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect
          after a restart or migration of the job, however.

     -t n[-m[:s]]
          Available for <I>qsub</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          Submits a so called <I>Array</I> <I>Job</I>, i.e. an array of identi-
          cal  tasks being only differentiated by an index number
          and being treated by Grid Engine almost like  a  series
          of jobs. The option argument to -t specifies the number
          of array job tasks and the index number which  will  be
          associated  with  the  tasks. The index numbers will be
          exported to the job tasks via the environment  variable
          SGE_TASK_ID.  The  option  arguments n, m and s will be
          available    through    the    environment    variables
          SGE_TASK_FIRST, SGE_TASK_LAST and  SGE_TASK_STEPSIZE.


          The task id range specified in the option argument  may
          be a single number, a simple range of the form n-m or a
          range with a step size. Hence, the task id range speci-
          fied  by  2-10:2 would result in the task id indexes 2,
          4, 6, 8, and 10, i.e. in a total of 5  tasks  identical
          tasks  with  the  environment variable SGE_TASK_ID con-
          taining one of the 5 index numbers each.

          All array job tasks inherit the same resource  requests
          and  attribute  definitions as specified in the <I>qsub</I> or
          <I>qalter</I> command line, except  for  the  -t  option.  The
          tasks  are scheduled independently and, provided enough
          resources, concurrently very much like  separate  jobs.
          However,  a  array  job  or  a sub-array thereof can be
          accessed  as  a  total  by  commands  like  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmod.html">qmod(1)</A></B>  or
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qdel.html">qdel(1)</A></B>.    See  the  corresponding  manual  pages  for
          further detail.

          Array jobs are commonly used to execute the  same  type
          of operation on varying input data sets correlated with
          the task index number. The number of tasks in  a  array
          job is unlimited.

          STDOUT and STDERR of array job tasks  will  be  written
          into different files with the default location

          &lt;jobname&gt;.['e'|'o']&lt;job_id&gt;'.'&lt;task_id&gt;

          In order to change this default, the -e and -o  options
          (see  above)  can  be  used  together  with  the pseudo
          environment variables $HOME, $USER, $JOB_ID, $JOB_NAME,
          $HOSTNAME, and $SGE_TASK_ID.

          Note, that you can use the output redirection to divert
          the  output  of  all  tasks into the same file, but the
          result of this is undefined.

     -u username,... | -uall
          Available for <I>qalter</I> only. Changes  are  only  made  on
          those  jobs  which were submitted by users specified in
          the list of usernames.  For managers it is possible  to
          use  the qalter -uall command to modify all jobs of all
          users.

          If you use the -u or -uall switch it is  not  permitted
          to specify an additional <I>job</I>/<I>task</I>_<I>id</I>_<I>list</I>.

     -v variable[=value],...
          Available for  <I>qsub</I>,  <I>qsh</I>,  <I>qrsh</I>,  <I>qlogin</I>,  <I>qalter</I>  and
          <I>qresub</I>.

          Defines or redefines the environment  variables  to  be
          exported  to  the execution context of the job.  If the
          -v option is present Grid Engine will add the  environ-
          ment  variables defined as arguments to the switch and,
          optionally, values of specified variables, to the  exe-
          cution context of the job.

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect
          after a restart or migration of the job, however.

     -verbose
          Available only for <I>qrsh</I> and <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmake.html">qmake(1)</A></B>.

          Unlike <I>qsh</I> and <I>qlogin</I>, <I>qrsh</I> does not output any  infor-
          mational  messages  while establishing the session com-
          pliant with the standard <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/rsh.html">rsh(1)</A></B>  and  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/rlogin.html">rlogin(1)</A></B>  system
          calls.   If the option -verbose is set, <I>qrsh</I> behaves as
          verbose as the <I>qsh</I>  and  <I>qlogin</I>  commands  and  outputs
          informations  about  the  process  of  establishing the
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/rsh.html">rsh(1)</A></B> or <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/rlogin.html">rlogin(1)</A></B> session.

     -verify
          Available for  <I>qsub</I>,  <I>qsh</I>,  <I>qrsh</I>,  <I>qlogin</I>,  <I>qalter</I>  and
          <I>qresub</I>.

          Does not submit a job but prints information on the job
          as  being  represented  by the current command-line and
          all pertinent external influences.

     -V   Available for  <I>qsub</I>,  <I>qsh</I>,  <I>qrsh</I>,  <I>qlogin</I>,  <I>qalter</I>  and
          <I>qresub</I>.

          Specifies that all environment variables active  within
          the <I>qsub</I> utility be exported to the context of the job.

     -w e|w|n|v
          Available for  <I>qsub</I>,  <I>qsh</I>,  <I>qrsh</I>,  <I>qlogin</I>,  <I>qalter</I>  and
          <I>qresub</I>.

          Specifies a validation level applied to the job  to  be
          submitted  (<I>qsub</I>,  <I>qlogin</I>,  and  <I>qsh</I>)  or the specified
          queued job (<I>qalter</I>).  The information  displayed  indi-
          cates  whether the job possibly can be scheduled assum-
          ing an  empty  system  with  no  other  jobs.  Resource
          requests exceeding the configured maximal thresholds or
          requesting unavailable resource attributes are possible
          causes for jobs to fail this validation.

          The specifiers e, w, n and v define the following vali-
          dation modes:

          `e'  error - jobs with invalid requests will be
               rejected; the default for <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qsh</I>
               and <I>qlogin</I>.
          `w'  warning - only a warning will be displayed
               for invalid requests.
          `n'  none - switches off validation; the default for
               <I>qsub</I> and <I>qalter</I>.
          `v'  verify - does not submit the job but prints
               extensive validation report.

          Note, that the necessary checks are performance consum-
          ing and hence the checking is switched off by default.

          Note also, that the reasons for job requirements  being
          invalid with respect to resource availability of queues
          are displayed in the "-w v" case using  the  format  as
          described  for  the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qstat.html">qstat(1)</A></B> -F option (see description
          of  Full  Format  in  section  OUTPUT  FORMATS  of  the
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qstat.html">qstat(1)</A></B> manual page.

     job/task_id_list
          Specified by the following form:
              <I>job</I>_<I>id</I>[.<I>task</I>_<I>range</I>][,<I>job</I>_<I>id</I>[.<I>task</I>_<I>range</I>],...]

          If present, the <I>task</I>_<I>range</I> restricts the effect of  the
          operation to the array job task range specified as suf-
          fix to the job id (see the -t  option  to  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>  for
          further details on array jobs).

          The task range specifier has the  form  n[-m[:s]].  The
          range  may  be a single number, a  simple range  of the
          form n-m or a range with a step size.

          Instead of job/task_id_list it is possible to  use  the
          keyword 'all' to modify all jobs of the current user.

     scriptfile
          Available for <I>qsub</I> only.

          The job's scriptfile.  If not present or if the operand
          is  the  single-character  string  '-',  <I>qsub</I> reads the
          script from standard input.

     script_args
          Available for <I>qsub</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

          Arguments to the  job.  Not  valid  if  the  script  is
          entered from standard input.

          <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while  the  job
          executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect
          after a restart or migration of the job, however.

     xterm_args
          Available for <I>qsh</I> only.

          Arguments to the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/xterm.html">xterm(1)</A></B> executable, as defined in the
          configuration.  For details, refer to <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B>).

ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
     SGE_ROOT       Specifies the location  of  the  Grid  Engine
                    standard configuration files.

     SGE_CELL       If set, specifies  the  default  Grid  Engine
                    cell.  To  address  a  Grid Engine cell <I>qsub</I>,
                    <I>qsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> or <I>qalter</I> use (in  the  order  of
                    precedence):

                         The name of the cell  specified  in  the
                         environment  variable SGE_CELL, if it is
                         set.

                         The  name  of  the  default  cell,  i.e.
                         default.

     SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL
                    If  set,  specifies  that  debug  information
                    should  be written to stderr. In addition the
                    level of detail in which debug information is
                    generated is defined.

     COMMD_PORT     If set,  specifies  the  tcp  port  on  which
                    <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_commd.html">sge_commd(8)</A></B>  is  expected to listen for com-
                    munication requests.  Most installations will
                    use  a  services  map entry instead to define
                    that port.

     COMMD_HOST     If set, specifies the host on which the  par-
                    ticular  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_commd.html">sge_commd(8)</A></B>  to  be  used  for Grid
                    Engine communication of the <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I>
                    or  <I>qalter</I>  client  resides.  Per default the
                    local host is used.

     In addition to those environment variables specified  to  be
     exported  to the job via the -v or the -V option (see above)
     <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, and <I>qlogin</I> add the following variables  with  the
     indicated values to the variable list:


     SGE_O_HOME     the home directory of the submitting client.

     SGE_O_HOST     the name of the host on which the  submitting
                    client is running.

     SGE_O_LOGNAME  the LOGNAME of the submitting client.

     SGE_O_MAIL     the MAIL of the submitting  client.  This  is
                    the mail directory of the submitting client.

     SGE_O_PATH     the executable search path of the  submitting
                    client.

     SGE_O_SHELL    the SHELL of the submitting client.

     SGE_O_TZ       the time zone of the submitting client.

     SGE_O_WORKDIR  the absolute  path  of  the  current  working
                    directory of the submitting client.

     Furthermore, Grid Engine sets additional variables into  the
     job's environment, as listed below.

     ARC            The Grid Engine architecture name of the node
                    on  which  the  job  is  running. The name is
                    compiled-in into the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> binary.

     SGE_CKPT_ENV   Specifies the checkpointing  environment  (as
                    selected with the -ckpt option) under which a
                    checkpointing  job  executes.  Only  set  for
                    checkpointing jobs.

     SGE_CKPT_DIR   Only set  for  checkpointing  jobs.  Contains
                    path  <I>ckpt</I>_<I>dir</I>  (see  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/checkpoint.html">checkpoint(5)</A></B>  ) of the
                    checkpoint interface.

     SGE_STDERR_PATH
                    the pathname of the file to which  the  stan-
                    dard  error  stream  of  the job is diverted.
                    Commonly used for enhancing the  output  with
                    error  messages from prolog, epilog, parallel
                    environment   start/stop   or   checkpointing
                    scripts.

     SGE_STDOUT_PATH
                    the pathname of the file to which  the  stan-
                    dard  output  stream  of the job is diverted.
                    Commonly used for enhancing the  output  with
                    messages   from   prolog,   epilog,  parallel
                    environment   start/stop   or   checkpointing
                    scripts.

     SGE_JOB_SPOOL_DIR
                    The  directory  used  by  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_shepherd.html">sge_shepherd(8)</A></B>  to
                    store  job related data during job execution.
                    This directory is owned by root or by a  Grid
                    Engine administrative account and commonly is
                    not open for read or write access to  regular
                    users.

     SGE_TASK_ID    The index number of  the  current  array  job
                    task (see -t option above). This is an unique
                    number in each array job and can be  used  to
                    reference  different  input data records, for
                    example. This environment variable is set  to
                    "undefined" for non-array jobs.

     SGE_TASK_FIRST The index number of the first array job  task
                    (see -t option above).

     SGE_TASK_LAST  The index number of the last array  job  task
                    (see -t option above).

     SGE_TASK_STEPSIZE
                    The stepsize of the array  job  specification
                    (see -t option above).

     ENVIRONMENT    The ENVIRONMENT variable is set to  BATCH  to
                    identify that the job is being executed under
                    Grid Engine control.

     HOME           The  user's  home  directory  path  from  the
                    <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/passwd.html">passwd(5)</A></B> file.

     HOSTNAME       The hostname of the node on which the job  is

     JOB_ID         A   unique   identifier   assigned   by   the
                    <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>  when  the  job was submitted.
                    The job ID is a decimal integer in the  range
                    1 to 99999.

     JOB_NAME       The job name. For batch jobs or jobs  submit-
                    ted  by  <I>qrsh</I> with a command, the job name is
                    built as basename of the <I>qsub</I> script filename
                    resp. the <I>qrsh</I> command.  For interactive jobs
                    it is set  to  `INTERACTIVE'  for  <I>qsh</I>  jobs,
                    `QLOGIN'  for  <I>qlogin</I>  jobs and `QRLOGIN' for
                    <I>qrsh</I> jobs without a command.

                    This default may be overwritten  by  the  -<I>N</I>.
                    option.

     LOGNAME        The user's  login  name  from  the  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/passwd.html">passwd(5)</A></B>
                    file.

     NHOSTS         The number of hosts in use by a parallel job.

     NQUEUES        The number of queues allocated  for  the  job
                    (always 1 for serial jobs).

     NSLOTS         The number of queue slots in use by a  paral-
                    lel job.

     PATH           A default shell search path of:
                    /usr/local/bin:/usr/ucb:/bin:/usr/bin

     PE             The parallel environment under which the  job
                    executes (for parallel jobs only).

     PE_HOSTFILE    The path of a file containing the  definition
                    of the virtual parallel machine assigned to a
                    parallel job by Grid Engine. See the descrip-
                    tion   of   the   $pe_hostfile  parameter  in
                    <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_pe.html">sge_pe(5)</A></B> for details on the format  of  this
                    file. The environment variable is only avail-
                    able for parallel jobs.

     QUEUE          The name of the queue in  which  the  job  is
                    running.

     REQUEST        Available for batch jobs only.

                    The request name of a job as  specified  with
                    the  -N  switch  (see  above) or taken as the
                    name of the job script file.

     RESTARTED      This variable is set to 1 if a job  was  res-
                    tarted either after a system crash or after a
                    migration in case of a checkpointing job. The
                    variable has the value 0 otherwise.

     SHELL          The user's login  shell  from  the  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/passwd.html">passwd(5)</A></B>
                    file. Note: This is not necessarily the shell
                    in use for the job.

     TMPDIR         The absolute  path  to  the  job's  temporary
                    working directory.

     TMP            The same as TMPDIR; provided for  compatibil-
                    ity with NQS.

     TZ             The  time   zone   variable   imported   from

                    file.

RESTRICTIONS
     There is no controlling terminal for batch jobs  under  Grid
     Engine  and  any  tests or actions on a controlling terminal
     will fail. If these operations are in your .login or  .cshrc
     file, they will possibly cause your job to abort.

     Insert the following test before any commands that  are  not
     pertinent to batch jobs in your .login:

          if ( $?JOB_NAME) then
               echo "Grid Engine spooled job"
               exit 0
          endif

     Don't forget to set your shell's search path in  your  shell
     start-up before this code.

EXIT STATUS
     The following exit values are returned:

     0    Operation was executed successfully.

     25   It was not possible to register a new job according  to
          the configured <I>max</I>_<I>u</I>_<I>jobs</I> or <I>max</I>_<I>jobs</I> limit. Additional
          information may be found in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B>

     &gt;0   Error occured.

EXAMPLES
     The following is the simplest form of a Grid  Engine  script
     file.

     =====================================================


     #!/bin/csh
        a.out


     =====================================================

     The next example is a more complex Grid Engine script.

     =====================================================

     #!/bin/csh

     # Which account to be charged cpu time
     #$ -A santa_claus

     # date-time to run, format [[CC]yy]MMDDhhmm[.SS]
     #$ -a 12241200

     # to run I want 6 or more parallel processes
     # under the PE pvm. the processes require
     # 128M of memory
     #$ -pe pvm 6- -l mem=128

     # If I run on dec_x put stderr in /tmp/foo, if I
     # run on sun_y, put stderr in /usr/me/foo
     #$ -e dec_x:/tmp/foo,sun_y:/usr/me/foo

     # Send mail to these users
     #$ -M santa@heaven,claus@heaven

     # Mail at beginning/end/on suspension
     #$ -m bes

     # Export these environmental variables
     #$ -v PVM_ROOT,FOOBAR=BAR

     # The job is located in the current
     # working directory.
     #$ -cwd

     a.out
