NAME
     calendar_conf - Grid Engine calendar configuration file for-
     mat

DESCRIPTION
     <I>calendar</I>_<I>conf</I> reflects the format of the Grid Engine  calen-
     dar  configuration.  The  definition of calendars is used to
     specify "on duty" and  "off  duty"  time  periods  for  Grid
     Engine  queues  on a time of day, day of week or day of year
     basis.  Various  calendars  can  be  implemented   and   the
     appropriate  calendar definition for a certain class of jobs
     can be attached to a queue.

     <I>calendar</I>_<I>conf</I> entries can be added, modified  and  displayed
     with  the  -<I>Acal</I>,  -<I>acal</I>,  -<I>Mcal</I>,  -<I>mcal</I>,  -<I>scal</I>  and -<I>scall</I>
     options to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B> or with the calendar configuration  dia-
     log  of the graphical user interface <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmon.html">qmon(1)</A></B>.  The format of
     the calendar configuration entries is defined as follows:

FORMAT
  calendar_name
     The name of the calendar to be used  when  attaching  it  to
     queues or when administering the calendar definition.

  year
     The queue status definition on a day of the year basis. This
     field  generally  will  specify on which days of a year (and
     optionally at which times on those days) a queue,  to  which
     the  calendar  is  attached, will change to a certain state.
     The syntax of the year field is defined as follows:

     year:=
         {year_day_range_list[=daytime_range_list][=state]
         |[year_day_range_list=]daytime_range_list[=state]
         |[year_day_range_list=][daytime_range_list=]state} ...

     Where

     <B>o</B>  at least one of  year_day_range_list,  daytime_range_list
        and state always have to be present,

     <B>o</B>  every day in the year is assumed  if  year_day_range_list
        is omitted,

     <B>o</B>  all day long is assumed if daytime_range_list is omitted,

     <B>o</B>  switching the queue  to  "off"  (i.e.  disabling  it)  is
        assumed if state is omitted,

     <B>o</B>  the queue is assumed  to  be  enabled  for  days  neither
        referenced      implicitly      (by      omitting     the
        year_day_range_list) nor explicitly

     and the syntactical components are defined as follows:

       year_day_range_list := {yearday-yearday|yearday},...
       daytime_range_list :=  hour[:minute][:second]-
                              hour[:minute][:second],...
       state :=     {on|off|suspended}
       year_day :=  month_day.month.year
       month_day := {1|2|...|31}
       month :=     {jan|feb|...|dec|1|2|...|12}
       year :=      {1970|1971|...|2037}

  week
     The queue status definition on a day of the week basis. This
     field  generally  will  specify on which days of a week (and
     optionally at which times on those days) a queue,  to  which
     the  calendar  is  attached, will change to a certain state.
     The syntax of the week field is defined as follows:

     week:=
         {week_day_range_list[=daytime_range_list][=state]
         |[week_day_range_list=]daytime_range_list[=state]
         |[week_day_range_list=][daytime_range_list=]state} ...

     Where

     <B>o</B>  at least one of  week_day_range_list,  daytime_range_list
        and state always have to be present,

     <B>o</B>  every day in the week is assumed  if  week_day_range_list
        is omitted,

     <B>o</B>  syntax and semantics of daytime_range_list and state  are
        identical  to  the  definition  given  for the year field
        above,

     <B>o</B>  the queue is assumed  to  be  enabled  for  days  neither
        referenced      implicitly      (by      omitting     the
        week_day_range_list) nor explicitly

     and where week_day_range_list is defined as

       week_day_range_list := {weekday-weekday|weekday},...
       week_day :=  {mon|tue|wed|thu|fri|sat|sun}

SEMANTICS
     Successive entries to the year and week fields (separated by
     blanks) are combined in compliance with the following rule:

     <B>o</B>  "off"-areas  are  overridden  by  overlapping  "on"-  and
        "suspended"-areas.


     Hence an entry of the form

       week  12-18 tue=13-17=on

     means that queues referencing the corresponding calendar are
     disabled  the  entire  week  with  the  exception of Tuesday
     between 13.00-17.00 where the queues are available.

EXAMPLES
     (The following  examples  are  contained  in  the  directory
     $SGE_ROOT/util/resources/calendars).

     <B>o</B>  Night, weekend and public holiday calendar:

        On public holidays "night" queues are explicitly enabled.
        On  working  days  queues  are  disabled between 6.00 and
        20.00. Saturday and  Sunday  are  implicitly  handled  as
        enabled times:

          calendar_name  night
          year           1.1.1999,6.1.1999,28.3.1999,30.3.1999-
          31.3.1999,18.5.1999-19.5.1999,3.10.1999,25.12.1999,26
          .12.1999=on
          week           mon-fri=6-20


     <B>o</B>  Day calendar:

        On public holidays "day"-queues are disabled. On  working
        days  such  queues  are  closed  during the night between
        20.00 and 6.00, i.e. the queues are also closed on Monday
        from  0.00  to 6.00 and on Friday from 20.00 to 24.00. On
        Saturday and Sunday the queues are disabled.

          calendar_name  day
          year           1.1.1999,6.1.1999,28.3.1999,30.3.1999-
          31.3.1999,18.5.1999-19.5.1999,3.10.1999,25.12.1999,26
          .12.1999
          week           mon-fri=20-6 sat-sun


     <B>o</B>  Night, weekend and public holiday calendar  with  suspen-
        sion:

        Essentially the same scenario as the  first  example  but
        queues are suspended instead of switching them "off".

          calendar_name  night_s
          year           1.1.1999,6.1.1999,28.3.1999,30.3.1999-
          31.3.1999,18.5.1999-19.5.1999,3.10.1999,25.12.1999,26
          .12.1999=on
          week           mon-fri=6-20=suspended

     <B>o</B>  Day calendar with suspension:

        Essentially the same scenario as the second  example  but
        queues are suspended instead of switching them "off".

          calendar_name  day_s
          year           1.1.1999,6.1.1999,28.3.1999,30.3.1999-
          31.3.1999,18.5.1999-19.5.1999,3.10.1999,25.12.1999,26
          .12.1999=suspended
          week           mon-fri=20-6=suspended sat-sun=suspend
