NAME
     user - Grid Engine Enterprise Edition user entry file format

DESCRIPTION
     The user object is only available in case of a  Grid  Engine
     Enterprise Edition system. Grid Engine has no user object.

     A user entry is used in Grid Engine  Enterprise  Edition  to
     store  ticket  and  usage  information  on a per user basis.
     Maintaining user entries for all users  participating  in  a
     Grid  Engine  Enterprise  Edition system is required if Grid
     Engine Enterprise Edition is operated  under  a  user  share
     tree policy.

     A list of currently configured user entries can be displayed
     via  the  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B>  -suserl  option.  The  contents  of each
     enlisted user entry can be shown via the -suser switch.  The
     output follows the <I>user</I> format description. New user entries
     can be created and existing can be modified via the  -auser,
     -muser and -duser options to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B>.
