NAME
     hostgroup - host group entry file format

DESCRIPTION
     A host group entry is used to merge host  names  to  groups.
     Each   host   group  entry  file defines one group. Inside a
     group definition file you  can  also  reference  to  groups.
     These  groups are called subgroups. A subgroup is referenced
     by the sign "@" as first character of the name.

     A list of currently configured host  group  entries  can  be
     displayed  via  the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html?pathrev=V60s2_BRANCH">qconf(1)</A></B> -shgrpl option. The contents of
     each enlisted host group entry can be shown via  the  -shgrp
     switch. The output follows the <I>hostgroup</I> format description.
     New host group entries can be created and  existing  can  be
     modified  via  the -ahgrp, -mhgrp, -dhgrp and -?attr options
     to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html?pathrev=V60s2_BRANCH">qconf(1)</A></B>.

FORMAT
     A host group entry contains following parameters:

     group_name keyword
          The group_name keyword defines  the  host  group  name.
          Host group names have to begin with a '@' character.


     hostlist
          The name of all hosts and host  groups  which  are  now
          member  of  the group specified with group_name. If The
          first character of the hostname is a "@" sign the  name
          is  used  to reference a <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/hostgroup.html?pathrev=V60s2_BRANCH">hostgroup(5)</A></B> which is taken as
          sub group of this group. Default for this parameter  is
          NONE



EXAMPLE
     This is a typical host group entry:


     group_name @bigMachines

     hostlist @solaris64 @solaris32 fangorn balrog

     The entry will define a new host group called  @bigMachines.
     In  this  host  group  are  the host fangorn, balrog and all
     members of the host groups @solaris64 and @solaris32.
