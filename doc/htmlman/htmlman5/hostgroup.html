NAME
     hostgroup - host group entry file format

DESCRIPTION
     A host group entry is used to merge host  names  to  groups.
     Each  host  group  entry  file defines one group. A group is
     referenced by the sign "@" as first character of  the  name.
     At  this  point of implementation you can use host groups in
     the <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/usermapping.html">usermapping(5)</A></B> configuration. Inside a group  definition
     file  you  can  also  reference  to  groups. This groups are
     called subgroups.


     Each line in the host group entry file specifies a host name
     or a group which belongs to this group.


     A list of currently configured host  group  entries  can  be
     displayed  via  the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B> -shgrpl option. The contents of
     each enlisted host group entry can be shown via  the  -shgrp
     switch. The output follows the <I>hostgroup</I> format description.
     New host group entries can be created and  existing  can  be
     modified  via  the  -ahgrp,  -mhgrp  and  -dhgrp  options to
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B>.

FORMAT
     A host group entry contains at least two parameters:

     group_name keyword
          The group_name keyword defines the host group name. The
          rest  of  the  textline  after the keyword "group_name"
          will be taken as host group name value.


     hostname
          The name of the host which is now member of  the  group
          specified  with  group_name.  If The first character of
          the hostname is a "@" sign the name is used  to  refer-
          ence a <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/hostgroup.html">hostgroup(5)</A></B> which is taken as sub group of this
          group.



EXAMPLE
     This is a typical host group entry:


     group_name bigMachines

     @calculate


     speedhost

     The entry will define a new host group  called  bigMachines.
     In  this host group is the host speedhost and all members of
     the host group calculate.
