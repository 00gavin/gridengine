NAME
     usermapping - user mapping entry file format

DESCRIPTION
     A usermapping entry is used to  define  alias  names  for  a
     cluster  user.  The users name known by the sheduling system
     is called cluster user. If the cluster  name  doesn't  match
     the  user account name on an execution host, the usermapping
     feature can solve the problem.

     Each line in the usermapping entry  file  specifies  a  user
     name and the host(s) where he has an account.

     A list of currently configured user mapping entries  can  be
     displayed  via  the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B> -sumapl option. The contents of
     each enlisted user mapping entry can be shown via the -sumap
     switch.  The  output follows the <I>usermapping</I> format descrip-
     tion. New user entries can be created and  existing  can  be
     modified  via  the  -aumap,  -mumap  and  -dumap  options to
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B>.

FORMAT
     A user mapping entry contains at least tree parameters:

     cluster_user keyword
          The cluster_user keyword defines the cluster user name.
          The   rest   of   the   textline   after   the  keyword
          "cluster_user" will be taken as cluster user value.


     name The user name on an execution host.

     hostname
          The name of the host where the user specified  in  name
          has an account.  If The first character of the hostname
          is a "@" sign the name is used  to  reference  a  <I>host-</I>
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/group.html">group(5)</A></B>.


EXAMPLE
     This is a typical user mapping entry for a cluster user map-
     ping:


     cluster_user office

     alice     wonderland, realworld, @office2

     The entry will map the user office which is defined  in  the
     cluster system to the user alice on the hosts wonderland and
     realworld. The "@" sign is used to reference a  host  group.
     So the user office is mapped to alice on all hosts specified
     in the host group office2. Please see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/hostgroup.html">hostgroup(5)</A></B> to obtain
     for more information about that.
