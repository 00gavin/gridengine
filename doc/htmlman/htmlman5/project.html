NAME
     project - Grid Engine project entry file format

DESCRIPTION
     Jobs can be submitted to projects,  and  a  project  can  be
     assigned  with  a  certain level of importance via the func-
     tional or the override policy. This level of  importance  is
     then inherited by the jobs executing under that project.

     A list of currently configured projects can be displayed via
     the  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B>  -sprjl  option. The contents of each enlisted
     project definition can be shown via the  -sprj  switch.  The
     output  follows the <I>project</I> format description. New projects
     can be created and existing can be modified via  the  -aprj,
     -mprj and -dprj options to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B>.

     Note, Grid Engine allows backslashes (\) be used  to  escape
     newline (\newline) characters. The backslash and the newline
     are replaced  with  a  space  ("  ")  character  before  any
     interpretation.
