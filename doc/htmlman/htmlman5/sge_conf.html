NAME
     sge_conf - Grid Engine configuration files

DESCRIPTION
     <I>sge</I>_<I>conf</I> defines the global and local Grid Engine configura-
     tions  and  can  be  shown/modified  by  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B>  using the
     -sconf/-mconf options. Only root or the cluster  administra-
     tor may modify <I>sge</I>_<I>conf</I>.

     At its initial start-up, <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> checks to see  if  a
     valid Grid Engine configuration is available at a well known
     location in the Grid Engine  internal  directory  hierarchy.
     If so, it loads that configuration information and proceeds.
     If not, <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> writes a generic  configuration  con-
     taining  default  values  to  that  same location.  The Grid
     Engine execution daemons <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> upon start-up retrieve
     their configuration from <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>.

     The  actual  configuration  for  both   <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>   and
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> is a superposition of a so called <I>global</I> confi-
     guration and a <I>local</I> configuration being pertinent  for  the
     host  on  which  a master or execution daemon resides.  If a
     local configuration is available, its entries overwrite  the
     corresponding entries of the global configuration. Note: The
     local configuration does not have to contain all valid  con-
     figuration entries, but only those which need to be modified
     against the global entries.

FORMAT
     The paragraphs that follow provide brief descriptions of the
     individual parameters that compose the global and local con-
     figurations for a Grid Engine cluster:

qmaster_spool_dir
     The location where the master spool directory resides.  Only
     the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> and <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_shadowd.html">sge_shadowd(8)</A></B> need to have access to
     this directory. It needs  read/write  permission  for  root,
     however. The master spool directory - in particular the jobs
     directory and the message log file - may become quite  large
     depending on the size of the cluster and the number of jobs.
     Be sure to allocate enough disk space  and  regularly  clean
     off the log files, e.g. via a <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/cron.html">cron(8)</A></B> job.

     Being  a  parameter  set  at  installation   time   changing
     qmaster_spool_dir in a running system is not supported.

     The default location  for  the  master  spool  directory  is
     &lt;sge_root&gt;/&lt;cell&gt;/spool/qmaster.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

execd_spool_dir
     The execution daemon spool directory path. Again, a feasible
     spool  directory  requires  read/write access permission for
     root. The entry in the global configuration for this parame-
     ter  can  be  overwritten by execution host local configura-
     tions, i.e. each  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B>  may  have  a  private  spool
     directory  with  a different path, in which case it needs to
     provide read/write permission for the root  account  of  the
     corresponding execution host only.

     Under execd_spool_dir a directory named corresponding to the
     unqualified  hostname  of  the  execution host is opened and
     contains all information spooled to disk. Thus, it is possi-
     ble  for the execd_spool_dirs of all execution hosts to phy-
     sically reference the same directory path (the  root  access
     restrictions mentioned above need to be met, however).

     Being a parameter set at installation time changing the glo-
     bal execd_spool_dir in a running system is not supported.

     The default location for the execution daemon  spool  direc-
     tory is &lt;sge_root&gt;/&lt;cell&gt;/spool.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

binary_path
     The directory path where the Grid Engine binaries reside. It
     is  used within Grid Engine components to locate and startup
     other Grid Engine programs.

     The path name given here is searched for binaries as well as
     any  directory  below  with  a  directory  name equal to the
     current   operating    system    architecture.    Therefore,
     /usr/SGE/bin   will  work  for  all  architectures,  if  the
     corresponding binaries are located in  subdirectories  named
     aix43, cray, glinux, hp10, irix6, osf4, solaris, etc.

     Each <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> may have its private binary path.   Chang-
     ing   the   binary  path  will  have  immediate  effect  for
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B>.

     The default location for the binary path is &lt;sge_root&gt;/bin

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

mailer
     mailer is the  absolute  pathname  to  the  electronic  mail
     delivery  agent on your system. It must accept the following
     syntax:

          mailer -s &lt;subject-of-mail-message&gt; &lt;recipient&gt;

     Each <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> may use a  private  mail  agent.  Changing
     mailer will take immediate effect.

     The default for mailer depends on the  operating  system  of
     the  host  on  which the Grid Engine master installation was
     run. Common values are /bin/mail or /usr/bin/Mail.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

xterm
     xterm is the absolute pathname to the X Window System termi-
     nal emulator, <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/xterm.html">xterm(1)</A></B>.

     Each <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> may use a  private  mail  agent.  Changing
     xterm will take immediate effect.

     The default for xterm is /usr/bin/X11/xterm.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

load_sensor
     A comma separated list of executable shell script  paths  or
     programs  to  be  started  by <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> and to be used in
     order to retrieve site configurable load  information  (e.g.
     free space on a certain disk partition).

     Each <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> may use a set of private load_sensor  pro-
     grams  or  scripts.  Changing  load_sensor  will take effect
     after two load report intervalls (see  load_report_time).  A
     load  sensor  will  be  restarted  automatically if the file
     modification time of the load sensor executable changes.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

     In addition to the load sensors configured via  load_sensor,
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_exec.html">sge_exec(8)</A></B>  searches for an executable file named <I>qloadsen-</I>
     <I>sor</I> in the execution host's  Grid  Engine  binary  directory
     path.   If such a file is found, it is treated like the con-
     figurable load sensors defined in load_sensor. This facility
     is intended for pre-installing a default load sensor.

prolog
     The executable path of a shell script that is started before
     execution of Grid Engine jobs with the same environment set-
     ting as that for the Grid Engine jobs to be  started  after-
     wards.  An  optional prefix "user@" specifies the user under
     which this procedure is to be started.   This  procedure  is
     intended  as  a  means  for the Grid Engine administrator to
     automate the execution of general site specific  tasks  like
     the  preparation of temporary file systems with the need for
     the same context information as the job.  Each  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B>
     may use a private prologue script. Correspondingly, the exe-
     cution host local configurations is can  be  overwritten  by
     the  queue configuration (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B> ). Changing pro-
     log will take immediate effect.

     Note: prolog is executed <I>exactly</I> as the job script.   There-
     fore,   all  implications  described  under  the  parameters
     shell_start_mode and login_shells below apply.

     The default for prolog is  the  special  value  NONE,  which
     prevents from execution of a prologue script.

     The following special variables being  expanded  at  runtime
     can  be  used  (besides  any  other strings which have to be
     interpreted by the procedure) to constitute a command line:

     $<I>host</I>
          The name of the host on which the prolog or epilog pro-
          cedures are started.

     $<I>job</I>_<I>owner</I>
          The user name of the job owner.

     $<I>job</I>_<I>id</I>
          Grid Engine's unique job identification number.

     $<I>job</I>_<I>name</I>
          The name of the job.

     $<I>processors</I>
          The processors string as contained in the queue  confi-
          guration  (see  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>) of the master queue (the
          queue in which the prolog  and  epilog  procedures  are
          started).

     $<I>queue</I>
          The master queue, i.e. the queue in  which  the  prolog
          and epilog procedures are started.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

epilog
     The executable path of a shell script that is started  after
     execution of Grid Engine jobs with the same environment set-
     ting as that for the Grid Engine jobs  that  has  just  com-
     pleted.  An optional prefix "user@" specifies the user under
     which this procedure is to be started.   This  procedure  is
     intended  as  a  means  for the Grid Engine administrator to
     automate the execution of general site specific  tasks  like
     the  cleaning up of temporary file systems with the need for
     the same context information as the job.  Each  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B>
     may use a private epilogue script. Correspondingly, the exe-
     cution host local configurations is can  be  overwritten  by
     the queue configuration (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B> ).  Changing epi-
     log will take immediate effect.

     Note: epilog is executed <I>exactly</I> as the job script.   There-
     fore,   all  implications  described  under  the  parameters
     shell_start_mode and login_shells below apply.

     The default for epilog is  the  special  value  NONE,  which
     prevents  from  execution  of  a epilogue script.  The  same
     special variables as for prolog can be used to constitute  a
     command line.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

shell_start_mode
     This parameter defines the  mechanisms  which  are  used  to
     actually  invoke the job scripts on the execution hosts. The
     following values are recognized:

     <I>unix</I>_<I>behavior</I>
          If a user starts a job shell script under UNIX interac-
          tively  by  invoking  it  just with the script name the
          operating system's executable loader uses the  informa-
          tion  provided in a comment such as `#!/bin/csh' in the
          first line of the script to detect which command inter-
          preter to start to interpret the script. This mechanism
          is  used  by  Grid  Engine  when   starting   jobs   if
          <I>unix</I>_<I>behavior</I> is defined as shell_start_mode.

     <I>posix</I>_<I>compliant</I>
          POSIX does not consider first script line comments such
          a `#!/bin/csh' as being significant. The POSIX standard
          for batch queuing systems (P1003.2d) therefore requires
          a  compliant queuing system to ignore such lines but to
          use user specified or configured default command inter-
          preters  instead.  Thus,  if shell_start_mode is set to
          <I>posix</I>_<I>compliant</I> Grid Engine will either use the command
          interpreter  indicated  by the -S option of the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>
          command or the shell parameter of the queue to be  used
          (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B> for details).

     <I>script</I>_<I>from</I>_<I>stdin</I>
          Setting  the  shell_start_mode  parameter   either   to
          <I>posix</I>_<I>compliant</I>  or  <I>unix</I>_<I>behavior</I>  requires you to set
          the umask in use for <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> such that every  user
          has  read  access  to  the active_jobs directory in the
          spool directory of the corresponding execution  daemon.
          In  case you have prolog and epilog scripts configured,
          they also need to be readable by any user who may  exe-
          cute jobs.
          If this violates your site's security policies you  may
          want to set shell_start_mode to <I>script</I>_<I>from</I>_<I>stdin</I>. This
          will force Grid Engine to open the job script  as  well
          as  the  epilogue and prologue scripts for reading into
          STDIN as root (if <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B>  was  started  as  root)
          before  changing  to the job owner's user account.  The
          script is then fed into the STDIN stream of the command
          interpreter  indicated  by the -S option of the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>
          command or the shell parameter of the queue to be  used
          (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B> for details).
          Thus setting shell_start_mode to <I>script</I>_<I>from</I>_<I>stdin</I> also
          implies  <I>posix</I>_<I>compliant</I>  behavior. Note, however, that
          feeding scripts into the  STDIN  stream  of  a  command
          interpreter  may  cause trouble if commands like <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/rsh.html">rsh(1)</A></B>
          are invoked inside a job script as  they  also  process
          the  STDIN  stream  of  the  command interpreter. These
          problems can usually be  resolved  by  redirecting  the
          STDIN  channel of those commands to come from /dev/null
          (e.g. rsh host date &lt; /dev/null). Note also,  that  any
          command-line options associated with the job are passed
          to the executing shell. The  shell  will  only  forward
          them  to  the  job  if they are not recognized as valid
          shell options.

     Changes to shell_start_mode will take immediate effect.  The
     default for shell_start_mode is <I>posix</I>_<I>compliant</I>.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

login_shells
     UNIX command interpreters like the Bourne-Shell (see  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sh.html">sh(1)</A></B>)
     or  the  C-Shell  (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/csh.html">csh(1)</A></B>) can be used by Grid Engine to
     start job scripts. The command interpreters  can  either  be
     started  as  login-shells  (i.e. all system and user default
     resource files like .login or .profile will be executed when
     the  command  interpreter is started and the environment for
     the job will be set up as if the user has just logged in) or
     just   for  command  execution  (i.e.  only  shell  specific
     resource files like .cshrc will be executed  and  a  minimal
     default environment is set up by Grid Engine - see <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>).
     The parameter login_shells contains a comma  separated  list
     of  the  executable  names of the command interpreters to be
     started as login-shells.   Shells  in  this  list  are  only
     started  as  login  shells if the parameter shell_start_mode
     (see above) is set to <I>posix</I>_<I>compliant</I>.
     Changes to login_shells will  take  immediate  effect.   The
     default for login_shells is sh,csh,tcsh,ksh.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

min_uid
     min_uid places a lower bound on user IDs that  may  use  the
     cluster. Users whose user ID (as returned by <B><A HREF="../htmlman3/getpwnam.html">getpwnam(3)</A></B>) is
     less than min_uid will not be allowed to  run  jobs  on  the
     cluster.

     Changes to min_uid will take immediate effect.  The  default
     for min_uid is 0.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

min_gid
     This parameter sets the lower bound on group  IDs  that  may
     use  the cluster.  Users whose default group ID (as returned
     by <B><A HREF="../htmlman3/getpwnam.html">getpwnam(3)</A></B>) is less than min_gid will not be allowed  to
     run jobs on the cluster.

     Changes to min_gid will take immediate effect.  The  default
     for min_gid is 0.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

user_lists
     The user_lists parameter contains a comma separated list  of
     so  called user access lists as described in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/access_list.html">access_list(5)</A></B>.
     Each user contained in at least one of the  enlisted  access
     lists has access to the cluster. If the user_lists parameter
     is set to NONE (the default) any user has access  being  not
     explicitly  excluded via the xuser_lists parameter described
     below.  If a user  is  contained  both  in  an  access  list
     enlisted  in  xuser_lists  and user_lists the user is denied
     access to the cluster.

     Changes to user_lists will take immediate effect

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

xuser_lists
     The xuser_lists parameter contains a comma separated list of
     so  called user access lists as described in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/access_list.html">access_list(5)</A></B>.
     Each user contained in at least one of the  enlisted  access
     lists  is  denied  access to the cluster. If the xuser_lists
     parameter is set to NONE (the default) any user has  access.
     If  a  user  is contained both in an access list enlisted in
     xuser_lists and user_lists (see above) the  user  is  denied
     access to the cluster.

     Changes to xuser_lists will take immediate effect

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

administrator_mail
     administrator_mail specifies a comma separated list  of  the
     electronic  mail address(es) of the cluster administrator(s)
     to whom internally-generated problem reports are  sent.  The
     mail  address  format depends on your electronic mail system
     and how it is configured; consult your  system's  configura-
     tion guide for more information.

     Changing administrator_mail  takes  immediate  effect.   The
     default for administrator_mail is an empty mail list.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

projects
     This parameter is only available for Grid Engine  Enterprise
     Edition systems. It is not present in Grid Engine.

     The projects list contains all projects  which  are  granted
     access  to Grid Engine Enterprise Edition. User belonging to
     none of these projects cannot  use  Grid  Engine  Enterprise
     Edition.  If  users  belong to projects in the projects list
     and the xprojects list (see below), they also cannot use the
     system.

     Changing projects takes immediate effect.  The  default  for
     projects is none.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

xprojects
     This parameter is only available for Grid Engine  Enterprise
     Edition systems. It is not present in Grid Engine.


     The xprojects list contains all projects which  are  granted
     access  to Grid Engine Enterprise Edition. User belonging to
     one of these projects cannot use Grid Engine Enterprise Edi-
     tion.  If users belong to projects in the projects list (see
     above) and the xprojects list, they also cannot use the sys-
     tem.

     Changing xprojects takes immediate effect.  The default  for
     xprojects is none.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

load_report_time
     System load is reported periodically by the  execution  dae-
     mons  to  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>.   The  parameter  load_report_time
     defines the time interval between load reports.

     Each <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> may use  a  different  load  report  time.
     Changing load_report_time will take immediate effect.

     Note: Be careful when modifying load_report_time.  Reporting
     load too frequently might block <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> especially if
     the number of execution hosts is large. Moreover, since  the
     system load typically increases and decreases smoothly, fre-
     quent load reports hardly offer any benefit.

     The default for load_report_time is 40 seconds.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

reschedule_unknown
     Determines whether  jobs  on  hosts  in  unknown  state  are
     rescheduled   and  thus  sent  to  other  hosts.  Hosts  are
     registered as unknown if <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_master.html">sge_master(8)</A></B> cannot establish con-
     tact  to the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> on those hosts (see max_unheard ).
     Likely reasons are a breakdown of the host or a breakdown of
     the network connection in between, but also <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> may
     not be executing on such hosts.

     In any case, Grid Engine can reschedule jobs running on such
     hosts  to  another  system.  reschedule_unknown controls the
     time which Grid Engine will wait before jobs are rescheduled
     after  a  host became unknown. The time format specification
     is hh:mm:ss. If the special value 00:00:00 is set, then jobs
     will not be rescheduled from this host.

     Rescheduling is only initiated for jobs which have activated
     the rerun flag (see the -r y option of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> and the rerun
     option  of   <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>).    Parallel   jobs   are   only
     rescheduled  if the host on which their master task executes
     is  in  unknown  state.  Checkpointing  jobs  will  only  be
     rescheduled when the when option of the corresponding check-
     pointing environment containes  an  appropriate  flag.  (see
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/checkpoint.html">checkpoint(5)</A></B>).   Interactive  jobs  (see  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsh.html">qsh(1)</A></B>,  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrsh.html">qrsh(1)</A></B>,
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qtcsh.html">qtcsh(1)</A></B>) are not rescheduled.

     The default for reschedule_unknown id 00:00:00

     The global configuration entry for this value  may  be  over
     written by the execution host local configuration.

stat_log_time
     Grid Engine periodically logs a snapshot of  the  status  of
     the queues currently configured in the cluster to disk.  The
     time interval in seconds between  consecutive  snapshots  is
     defined by stat_log_time.

     Changing stat_log_time takes immediate effect.  The  default
     for stat_log_time is 2 hours 30 minutes.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

max_unheard
     If <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> could not contact or was not contacted  by
     the  execution daemon of a host for max_unheard seconds, all
     queues residing on that particular host are  set  to  status
     unknown.   <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>,  at least, should be contacted by
     the execution daemons in order  to  get  the  load  reports.
     Thus,    max_unheard    should    by    greater   than   the
     load_report_time (see above).

     Changing max_unheard takes immediate  effect.   The  default
     for max_unheard is 2 minutes 30 seconds.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

loglevel
     This parameter specifies  the  level  of  detail  that  Grid
     Engine components such as <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> or <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> use
     to produce informative, warning or error messages which  are
     logged  to  the  <I>messages</I>  files in the master and execution
     daemon  spool  directories  (see  the  description  of   the
     qmaster_spool_dir  and the execd_spool_dir parameter above).
     The following message levels are available:

     <I>log</I>_<I>err</I>
          All error events being recognized are logged.

     <I>log</I>_<I>warning</I>
          All error events  being  recognized  and  all  detected
          signs of potentially erroneous behavior are logged.

     <I>log</I>_<I>info</I>
          All error events being recognized, all  detected  signs
          of  potentially  erroneous  behavior  and  a variety of
          informative messages are logged.

     Changing loglevel will take immediate effect.

     The default for loglevel is <I>log</I>_<I>info</I>.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

max_aj_instances
     This parameter defines the maximum amount of array  task  to
     be  scheduled  to  run  simultaneously  per  array  job.  An
     instance of an array task will be created within the  master
     daemeon  when  it gets a start order from the scheduler. The
     instance will be destroyed when  the  array  task  finishes.
     Thus  the  parameter provides control mainly over the memory
     consumption of array jobs in the master and  scheduler  dae-
     mon.  It  is  most  useful  for very large clusters and very
     large array jobs.  The default for this parameter  is  2000.
     The  value  0  will deactivate this limit and will allow the
     scheduler to start as  many  array  job  tasks  as  suitable
     resources are available in the cluster.

     Changing max_aj_instances will take immediate effect.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

max_aj_tasks
     This parameter defines the maximum number of array job tasks
     within  an  array job.  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> will reject all array
     job submissions which request more than  max_aj_tasks  array
     job  tasks.  The  default  for  this parameter is 75000. The
     value 0 will deactivate this limit.

     Changing max_aj_tasks will take immediate effect.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

max_u_jobs
     The number of active (not finished)  jobs  which  each  Grid
     Engine  user  can  have in the system simultaneously is con-
     trolled by this parameter. A value greater  than  0  defines
     the  limit.  The  default  value 0 means "unlimited". If the
     max_u_jobs limit is exceeded by a job  submission  then  the
     submission   command  exits  with  exit  status  25  and  an
     appropriate error message.

     Changing max_u_jobs will take immediate effect.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

max_jobs
     The number of  active  (not  finished)  jobs  simultaneously
     allowed  in Grid Engine.  is controlled by this parameter. A
     value greater than 0 defines the limit. The default value  0
     means  "unlimited".  If  the max_jobs limit is exceeded by a
     job submission then the submission command exits  with  exit
     status 25 and an appropriate error message.

     Changing max_jobs will take immediate effect.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

enforce_project
     This parameter is only available for Grid Engine  Enterprise
     Edition systems. It is not present in Grid Engine.

     If set to <I>true</I>, users are  required  to  request  a  project
     whenever  submitting a job. See the -P option to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> for
     details.

     Changing enforce_project will take  immediate  effect.   The
     default for enforce_project is <I>false</I>.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

enforce_user
     This parameter is only available for Grid Engine  Enterprise
     Edition systems. It is not present in Grid Engine.

     If set to <I>true</I>, a Grid  Engine  Enterprise  Edition  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/user.html">user(5)</A></B>
     must  exists  to allow for job submission. Jobs are rejected
     if no corresponding user exists.

     Changing  enforce_user  will  take  immediate  effect.   The
     default for enforce_user is <I>false</I>.
     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

set_token_cmd
     This parameter is only present if your Grid Engine system is
     licensed to support AFS.

     Set_token_cmd points to a command which sets and extends AFS
     tokens for Grid Engine jobs. In the standard Grid Engine AFS
     distribution, it is supplied as a script which  expects  two
     command  line  parameters.  It  reads  the token from STDIN,
     extends the token's expiration time and sets the token:

          &lt;set_token_cmd&gt; &lt;user&gt; &lt;token_extend_after_seconds&gt;

     As a shell script this command will call the programs:

          - SetToken
          - forge

     which are provided by your distributor as source  code.  The
     script looks as follows:

          --------------------------------
          #!/bin/sh
          # set_token_cmd
          forge -u $1 -t $2 | SetToken
          --------------------------------

     Since it is necessary for  <I>forge</I>  to  read  the  secret  AFS
     server  key,  a site might wish to replace the set_token_cmd
     script by a command, which connects to a self written daemon
     at  the  AFS  server.  The  token  must be forged at the AFS
     server and returned to the local machine, where <I>SetToken</I>  is
     executed.

     Changing set_token_cmd  will  take  immediate  effect.   The
     default for set_token_cmd is none.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

pag_cmd
     This parameter is only present if your Grid Engine system is
     licensed to support AFS.

     The path to your <I>pagsh</I> is specified via this parameter.  The
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_shepherd.html">sge_shepherd(8)</A></B>  process  and the job run in a <I>pagsh</I>. Please
     ask your AFS administrator for details.


     Changing pag_cmd will take immediate  effect.   The  default
     for pag_cmd is none.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

token_extend_time
     This parameter is only present if your Grid Engine system is
     licensed to support AFS.

     the time  period  for  which  AFS  tokens  are  periodically
     extended.  Grid  Engine  will  call  the  token extension 30
     minutes before the tokens expire until  jobs  have  finished
     and the corresponding tokens are no longer required.

     Changing token_extend_time will take immediate effect.   The
     default for token_extend_time is 24:0:0, i.e. 24 hours.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

gid_range
     The gid_range is a comma separated list of range expressions
     of  the  form  n-m  (n  as well as m being positive non-zero
     integer numbers), where m is an abbreviation for m-m.  These
     numbers  are  used  in  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B>  to  identify processes
     belonging to the same job.

     Each <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> may use a separate set up  group  ids  for
     this  purpose.   All number in the group id range have to be
     unused supplementary group ids  on  the  system,  where  the
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> is started.

     Changing gid_range will take immediate effect.  There is  no
     default for gid_range. The administrator will have to assign
     a value for gid_range during  installation  of  Grid  Engine
     Enterprise Edition.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

qmaster_params
     A list of additional parameters can be passed  to  the  Grid
     Engine qmaster. The following values are recognized:

     <I>ENABLE</I>_<I>FORCED</I>_<I>QDEL</I>
          If this parameter is set, non-administrative users  can
          foce  deletion  of  their own jobs via the -<I>f</I> option of
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qdel.html">qdel(1)</A></B>.  Without this parameter,  forced  deletion  of
          jobs  is  only  allowed  by  the Grid Engine manager or
          operator.

          Note: Forced deletion for jobs is executed  differently
          depending  on whether users are Grid Engine administra-
          tors or not. In case of administrative users, the  jobs
          are  removed  from the internal database of Grid Engine
          immediately. For regular users,  the  equivalent  of  a
          normal  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qdel.html">qdel(1)</A></B>  is  executed  first,  and  deletion is
          forced only if the normal cancellation  was  unsuccess-
          ful.

          Changing qmaster_params  will  take  immediate  effect.
          The default for qmaster_params is none.

          This value is a global configuration parameter only. It
          cannot  be overwritten by the execution host local con-
          figuration.

     <I>FORBID</I>_<I>RESCHEDULE</I>
          If this parameter is set, re-queuing of jobs cannot  be
          initiated  by  the job script which is under control of
          the user. Without this  parameter  jobs  returning  the
          value 99 are rescheduled. This can be used to cause the
          job  to  be  restarted  at  a  different  machine,  for
          instance  if  there  are  not  enough  resources on the
          current one.

     <I>DISABLE</I>_<I>AUTO</I>_<I>RESCHEDULING</I>
          If set to "true" or "1", the <I>reschedule</I>_<I>unknown</I> parame-
          ter is not taken into account.

     Changing qmaster_params will  take  immediate  effect.   The
     default for qmaster_params is none.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

schedd_params
     This is foreseen for passing additional  parameters  to  the
     Grid  Engine  scheduler. The following values are recognized
     currently:

     <I>FLUSH</I>_<I>SUBMIT</I>_<I>SEC</I>, <I>FLUSH</I>_<I>FINISH</I>_<I>SEC</I>
          The parameters are provided  for  tuning  the  system's
          scheduling  behavior.   By  default, a scheduler run is
          triggered in the scheduler interval which is defined in
          the  scheduler  configuration  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sched_conf.html">sched_conf(5)</A></B>, parameter
          schedule_interval.
          The parameters FLUSH_SUBMIT_SEC/FLUSH_FINISH_SEC define
          the  time  gaps  between triggering a scheduler run and
          the submitting/finishing of a job.
          The most immediate scheduler reaction can be  activated
          by  setting  both  values  to 0. The default scheduling
          behavior is enforced by either removing the  parameters
          or setting them to a value of -1.

     <I>CLASSIC</I>_<I>SGEEE</I>_<I>SCHEDULING</I>
          If set to "true" or "1", use the original SGEEE pending
          job  scheduling  algorithm.  The original SGEEE pending
          job scheduling algorithm  calculates  the  tickets  for
          pending  jobs  by  dividing  up  the  tickets  in  each
          scheduling policy among  all  the  active  and  pending
          jobs. The pending job list is then ordered based on the
          tickets assigned to the pending jobs. The default value
          is  "false".  This  parameter  is only valid in a SGEEE
          system.

     <I>POLICY</I>_<I>HIERARCHY</I>
          This parameter sets up a dependency chain of  policies.
          Each  policy  in  the dependency chain is influenced by
          the previous policies and influences the following pol-
          icies.  A  typical scenario is to assign precedence for
          the override policy over the  share-based  policy.  The
          override  policy  determines  in such a case how share-
          based tickets are assigned among jobs of the same  user
          or  project.   Note that all policies contribute to the
          ticket amount assigned to a particular  job  regardless
          of  the  policy  hierarchy  definition. Yet the tickets
          calculated in each of the  policies  can  be  differend
          depending on "<I>POLICY</I>_<I>HIERARCHY</I>".

          The "<I>POLICY</I>_<I>HIERARCHY</I>" parameter  can  be  a  up  to  4
          letter  combination of the first letters of the 4 poli-
          cies  S(hare-based),   F(unctional),   D(eadline)   and
          O(verride).  So  a value "OFSD" means that the override
          policy takes precedence  over  the  functional  policy,
          which  influences  the  share-based  policy  and  which
          finaly  preceeds  the  deadline  policy.  Less  than  4
          letters mean that some of the policies do not influence
          other policies and also are  not  influenced  by  other
          policies.  So a value of "FS" means that the functional
          policy influences the share-based policy and that there
          is no interference with the other policies.

          The special value "NONE" switches  off  policy  hierar-
          chies.

     <I>SHARE</I>_<I>OVERRIDE</I>_<I>TICKETS</I>
          If set to "true" or "1", override tickets of any  over-
          ride  object instance are shared equally among all jobs
          associated with the object. If set to "false"  or  "0",
          each  job  gets  the full value of the override tickets
          associated  with  the  object.  The  default  value  is
          "true". This parameter is only valid in a SGEEE system.

     <I>SHARE</I>_<I>FUNCTIONAL</I>_<I>SHARES</I>
          If set to "true" or "1", functional shares of any func-
          tional  object  instance  are shared among all the jobs
          associated with the object. If set to "false"  or  "0",
          each  job associated with a functional object, gets the
          full functional shares  of  that  object.  The  default
          value  is  "true".  This  parameter  is only valid in a
          SGEEE system.

     <I>SHARE</I>_<I>DEADLINE</I>_<I>TICKETS</I>
          If set to "true" or "1", the total deadline tickets are
          shared  among  all  deadline jobs. If set to "false" or
          "0", each deadline job will receive the total  deadline
          tickets  once  the  job  deadline has been reached. The
          default value is "true". This parameter is  only  valid
          in a SGEEE system.

     <I>MAX</I>_<I>FUNCTIONAL</I>_<I>JOBS</I>_<I>TO</I>_<I>SCHEDULE</I>
          The maximum number of pending jobs to schedule  in  the
          functional  policy.  The  default  value  is  200. This
          parameter is only valid in a SGEEE system.

     <I>MAX</I>_<I>PENDING</I>_<I>TASKS</I>_<I>PER</I>_<I>JOB</I>
          The maximum number of subtasks per pending array job to
          schedule.  This  parameter  exists  in  order to reduce
          scheduling overhead. The default  value  is  50.   This
          parameter is only valid in a SGEEE system.

     <I>PROFILE</I>
          If set, the scheduler logs profiling  information  sum-
          marizing each scheduling run.

     Changing schedd_params  will  take  immediate  effect.   The
     default for schedd_params is none.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

execd_params
     This is foreseen for passing additional  parameters  to  the
     Grid  Engine  execution  daemon.  The  following  values are
     recognized:

     <I>ACCT</I>_<I>RESERVED</I>_<I>USAGE</I>
          If this parameter is set to true, for reserved usage is
          used for the accounting entries cpu, mem and io instead
          of the measured usage.

     <I>KEEP</I>_<I>ACTIVE</I>
          This value should only be set for  debugging  purposes.
          If  set  to  true, the execution daemon will not remove
          the spool directory maintained by <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_shepherd.html">sge_shepherd(8)</A></B> for a
          job.

     <I>NO</I>_<I>REPRIORITIZATION</I>
          If set to "true"  or  "1",  jobs  are  not  repriorized
          dynamically.  Without setting this attribute the prior-
          ity parameter in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sched_conf.html">sched_conf(5)</A></B> has no durable effect in
          a SGEEE system because of dynamic reprioritization per-
          formed by the PTF module inside <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B>.

     <I>PTF</I>_<I>MIN</I>_<I>PRIORITY</I>, <I>PTF</I>_<I>MAX</I>_<I>PRIORITY</I>
          The parameters are only  available  in  a  Grid  Engine
          Enterprise Edition system.
          The maximum/minumum priority which Grid  Engine  Enter-
          prise  Edition will assign to a job.  Typically this is
          a negative/postive value in the range of -20  (maximum)
          to  19  (minimum)  for  systems  which allow setting of
          priorties with the <B><A HREF="../htmlman2/nice.html">nice(2)</A></B> system call.  Other  systems
          may provide different ranges.
          The default priority range (varies from system to  sys-
          tem)  is installed either by removing the parameters or
          by setting a value of -999.
          See the "messages" file of the execution daemon for the
          predefined  default value on your hosts. The values are
          logged during the startup of the execution daemon.

     <I>NOTIFY</I>_<I>KILL</I>
          The parameter allows you  to  change  the  notification
          signal  for  the  signal SIGKILL (see -<I>notify</I> option of
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>).  The parameter either  accepts  signal  names
          (use  the  -<I>l</I>  option  of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/kill.html">kill(1)</A></B>) or the special value
          <I>none</I>. If set to <I>none</I>, no notification  signal  will  be
          sent.  If  it  is set to <I>TERM</I>, for instance, or another
          signal name then this signal will be sent as  notifica-
          tion signal.

     <I>NOTIFY</I>_<I>SUSP</I>
          With this parameter it is possible to modify the notif-
          ication  signal  for  the  signal  SIGSTOP (see -<I>notify</I>
          parameter of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>).  The  parameter  either  accepts
          signal names (use the -<I>l</I> option of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/kill.html">kill(1)</A></B>) or the spe-
          cial value <I>none</I>. If set to <I>none</I>, no notification signal
          will  be  sent.  If it is set to <I>TSTP</I>, for instance, or
          another signal name then this signal will  be  sent  as
          notification signal.

     <I>SET</I>_<I>SGE</I>_<I>ENV</I>, <I>SET</I>_<I>COD</I>_<I>ENV</I>, <I>SET</I>_<I>GRD</I>_<I>ENV</I>
          In <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> you can find a list of environment variables
          which  are  exported  into the execution environment of
          each Grid Engine Enterprise Edition job. Some of  these
          variables  names  begin  with the prefix "SGE_". In the
          predecessor products of Grid Engine Enterprise  Edition
          (Codine,  GRD) the prefixes "COD_" and "GRD_" were used
          for those variables. This makes it necessary to  update
          all  job scripts relying one of those environment vari-
          ables.  The  parameters  SET_SGE_ENV,  SET_COD_ENV  and
          SET_GRD_ENV  can be used to accomplish a smoother tran-
          sition from Codine/GRD to Grid Engine  Enterprise  Edi-
          tion.

          Each of those parameters  makes  sure  that  a  set  of
          environment  variables  mentioned in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> and begin-
          ning with the corresponding  prefix  will  be  exported
          into the job environmnet. Every parameter can be set to
          "true",   "1"   or   "false",   "0".    Defaults    are
          "SET_SGE_ENV=1, SET_COD_ENV=0 and SET_GRD_ENV=0".

          If all three parameters are set to "false" or "0"  jobs
          might  fail  as  none  of the corresponding environment
          variables would be set.  Therefore  in  this  case  the
          environment  variables beginning with the prefix "SGE_"
          are set.

     <I>SHARETREE</I>_<I>RESERVED</I>_<I>USAGE</I>
          If this parameter is set to  true,  reserved  usage  is
          taken for the Grid Engine Enterprise Edition share tree
          consumption instead of measured usage.

     Changing  execd_params  will  take  immediate  effect.   The
     default for execd_params is none.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

     <I>USE</I>_<I>QSUB</I>_<I>GID</I>
          If this parameter is set to true, the primary group  id
          being  active  when  a job was submitted will be set to
          become the primary group id for job execution.  If  the
          parameter  is  not set, the primary group id as defined
          for the job owner in the execution host <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/passwd.html">passwd(5)</A></B>  file
          is used.
          The feature is only available for  jobs  submitted  via
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrsh.html">qrsh(1)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmake.html">qmake(1)</A></B> and <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qtcsh.html">qtcsh(1)</A></B>.  Also, it only
          works for <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrsh.html">qrsh(1)</A></B> jobs (and thus also for <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qtcsh.html">qtcsh(1)</A></B>  and
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmake.html">qmake(1)</A></B>) if rsh and rshd components are used which are
          provided with Grid Engine  (i.e.,  the  rsh_daemon  and
          rsh_command  parameters  may  not  be  changed from the
          default).

admin_user
     Administrative user account used  by  Grid  Engine  for  all
     internal  file  handling  (status spooling, message logging,
     etc.). Can be used in cases where the root account does  not
     have  the  corresponding  file access permissions (e.g. on a
     shared file system without global root read/write access).

     Being  a  parameter  set  at  installation   time   changing
     admin_user in a running system is not supported. Changing it
     manually on a shut-down cluster is possible, but  if  access
     to  the  Grid Engine spooling area is interrupted, this will
     result in unpredictable behaviour.

     The admin_user parameter has no default value,  but  instead
     it is defined during the master installation procedure.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

finished_jobs
     Grid Engine stores a certain number of <I>just</I> <I>finished</I> jobs to
     provide  post  mortem  status information. The finished_jobs
     parameter defines the number of finshed jobs  being  stored.
     If  this  maximum  number is reached, the eldest finshed job
     will be discarded for every  now  job  being  added  to  the
     finshed job list.

     Changing finished_jobs  will  take  immediate  effect.   The
     default for finished_jobs is 0.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

qlogin_daemon
     This parameter  specifies  the  executable  that  is  to  be
     started  on  the server side of a <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qlogin.html">qlogin(1)</A></B> request. Usually
     this is the fully qualified pathname of the system's  telnet
     daemon. If no value is given, a specialized Grid Engine com-
     ponent is used.

     Changing qlogin_daemon  will  take  immediate  effect.   The
     default for qlogin_daemon is none.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

qlogin_command
     This is the command to be executed on the client side  of  a
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qlogin.html">qlogin(1)</A></B>  request.   Usually  this  is  the fully qualified
     pathname of the systems's telnet client program. If no value
     is given, a specialized Grid Engine component is used. It is
     automatically started with the target host and  port  number
     as parameters.


     Changing qlogin_command will  take  immediate  effect.   The
     default for qlogin_command is none.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

rlogin_daemon
     This parameter  specifies  the  executable  that  is  to  be
     started  on  the  server side of a <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrsh.html">qrsh(1)</A></B> request without a
     command argument to be executed remotely.  Usually  this  is
     the  fully qualified pathname of the system's rlogin daemon.
     If no value is given, a specialized Grid Engine component is
     used.

     Changing  rlogin_daemon  will  take  immediate  effect.  The
     default for rlogin_daemon is none.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

rlogin_command
     This is the command to be executed on the client side  of  a
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrsh.html">qrsh(1)</A></B>  request  without  a command argument to be executed
     remotely. Usually this is the fully  qualified  pathname  of
     the  system's rlogin client program. If no value is given, a
     specialized Grid Engine component is used.  The  command  is
     automatically  started  with the target host and port number
     as parameters like required for <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/telnet.html">telnet(1)</A></B>.  The Grid  Engine
     rlogin  client  has  been extened to accept and use the port
     number argument. You can only  use  clients,  such  as  <I>ssh</I>,
     which also understand this syntax.

     Changing rlogin_command  will  take  immediate  effect.  The
     default for rlogin_command is none.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

rsh_daemon
     This parameter  specifies  the  executable  that  is  to  be
     started  on the server side of a <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrsh.html">qrsh(1)</A></B> request with a com-
     mand argument to be executed remotely.  Usually this is  the
     fully  qualified  pathname of the system's rsh daemon. If no
     value is given, a specialized Grid Engine component is used.

     Changing rsh_daemon will take immediate effect. The  default
     for rsh_daemon is none.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.


rsh_command
     This is the command to be executed on the client side  of  a
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrsh.html">qrsh(1)</A></B>  request  with  a  command  argument  to be executed
     remotely. Usually this is the fully  qualified  pathname  of
     the  system's  rsh  client  program. If no value is given, a
     specialized Grid Engine component is used.  The  command  is
     automatically  started  with the target host and port number
     as parameters like required for <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/telnet.html">telnet(1)</A></B> plus  the  command
     with  its arguments to be executed remotely. The Grid Engine
     rsh client has been extened  to  accept  and  use  the  port
     number  argument.  You  can  only  use clients, such as <I>ssh</I>,
     which also understand this syntax.

     Changing rsh_command will take immediate effect. The default
     for rsh_command is none.

     The  global  configuration  entry  for  this  value  may  be
     overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

ignore_fqdn
     Ignore fully qualified domain name component  of  hostnames.
     Should  be set if all hosts belonging to a Grid Engine clus-
     ter are part of a single DNS domain. It is  switched  on  if
     set to either "true" or "1". Switching it on may solve prob-
     lems with load reports due to different hostname resolutions
     across the cluster.

     Being  a  parameter  set  at  installation   time   changing
     ignore_fqdn  in  a  running  system  is  not  supported. The
     default for ignore_fqdn is "true".

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not  be  overwritten  by the execution host local configura-
     tion.

default_domain
     Only needed if your Grid Engine cluster covers hosts belong-
     ing to more than a single DNS domain. In this case it can be
     used if your hostname resolving yields  both  qualified  and
     unqualified  hostnames  for  the  hosts  in  one  of the DNS
     domains. The value of  default_domain  is  appended  to  the
     unqualified  hostname  to define a fully qualified hostname.
     The  default_domain  parameter  will  have  no   effect   if
     ignore_fqdn is set to "true".

     Being  a  parameter  set  at  installation   time   changing
     default_domain  in  a  running  system is not supported. The
     default for default_domain is "none", in which case it  will
     not be used.

     This value is a global configuration parameter only. It can-
     not   be   overwritten   by   the   execution   host   local
     configuration.
