NAME
     sched_conf - Grid  Engine  default  scheduler  configuration
     file

DESCRIPTION
     <I>sched</I>_<I>conf</I> defines the configuration file  format  for  Grid
     Engine's  default  scheduler  provided by <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_schedd.html">sge_schedd(8)</A></B>.  In
     order to modify the configuration, use the graphical  user's
     interface <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmon.html">qmon(1)</A></B> or the -<I>msconf</I> option of the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B> com-
     mand. A default configuration is provided together with  the
     Grid Engine distribution package.

FORMAT
     The following parameters are recognized by the  Grid  Engine
     scheduler if present in <I>sched</I>_<I>conf</I>:

  algorithm
     Allows for the selection  of  alternative  scheduling  algo-
     rithms.

     Currently default is the only allowed setting.

  load_formula
     A simple  algebraic  expression  used  to  derive  a  single
     weighted  load value from all or part of the load parameters
     reported by <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> for each host and from all or  part
     of  the  consumable  resources  (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html">complex(5)</A></B>) being main-
     tained for each host.  The load formula expression syntax is
     that of a summation weighted load values, that is:

          load_val1[*w1][{+|-}load_val2[*w2][{+|-}...]]

     Note, no blanks are allowed in the load formula.
     The load values and consumable  resources  (load_val1,  ...)
     are  specified  by the name defined in the complex (see <I>com-</I>
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/plex.html">plex(5)</A></B>).
     Note: Administrator defined load values (see the load_sensor
     parameter   in   <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B>  for  details)  and  consumable
     resources available for all hosts (see  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html">complex(5)</A></B>)  may  be
     used as well as Grid Engine default load parameters.
     The weighting factors (w1, ...) are positive integers. After
     the  expression  is  evaluated for each host the results are
     assigned to the  hosts  and  are  used  to  sort  the  hosts
     corresponding  to the weighted load. The sorted host list is
     used to sort queues subsequently.
     The default load formula is "load_avg".

  job_load_adjustments
     The load, which is imposed by the Grid Engine  jobs  running
     on  a  system  varies  in  time, and often, e.g. for the CPU
     load, requires some amount of time to  be  reported  in  the
     appropriate  quantity by the operating system. Consequently,
     if a job was started very recently, the  reported  load  may
     not provide a sufficient representation of the load which is
     already imposed on that host by the job. The  reported  load
     will  adapt  to  the  real load over time, but the period of
     time, in which the reported load is  too  low,  may  already
     lead to an oversubscription of that host. Grid Engine allows
     the administrator to specify job_load_adjustments which  are
     used  in  the  Grid  Engine scheduler to compensate for this
     problem.
     The job_load_adjustments are specified as a comma  separated
     list  of  arbitrary  load parameters or consumable resources
     and (separated by an equal sign) an associated load  correc-
     tion  value.  Whenever  a  job  is  dispatched  to a host by
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_schedd.html">sge_schedd(8)</A></B>, the load parameter and consumable  value  set
     of  that  host  is  increased  by the values provided in the
     job_load_adjustments  list.  These  correction  values   are
     decayed      linearly      over     time     until     after
     load_adjustment_decay_time from the  start  the  corrections
     reach  the  value  0.   If  the job_load_adjustments list is
     assigned the special denominator NONE, no  load  corrections
     are performed.
     The adjusted load and consumable values are used to  compute
     the  combined  and  weighted  load  of  the  hosts  with the
     load_formula (see above) and to compare the load and consum-
     able  values against the load threshold lists defined in the
     queue   configurations   (see   <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>).    If   your
     load_formula simply consists of the CPU load average parame-
     ter <I>load</I>_<I>avg</I> and if your jobs are  very  compute  intensive,
     you  might  want  to  set  the  job_load_adjustments list to
     <I>load</I>_<I>avg</I>=<I>100</I>, which means that every new job dispatched to a
     host will require 100 % CPU time and thus the machine's load
     is instantly raised by 100.

  load_adjustment_decay_time
     The load  corrections  in  the  "job_load_adjustments"  list
     above  are  decayed linearly over time from the point of the
     job start, where the corresponding load or consumable param-
     eter  is  raised by the full correction value, until after a
     time  period  of  "load_adjustment_decay_time",  where   the
     correction      becomes     0.     Proper     values     for
     "load_adjustment_decay_time" greatly depend upon the load or
     consumable   parameters  used  and  the  specific  operating
     system(s). Therefore, they can only  be  determined  on-site
     and experimentally.  For the default <I>load</I>_<I>avg</I> load parameter
     a "load_adjustment_decay_time" of 7 minutes  has  proven  to
     yield reasonable results.

  maxujobs
     The maximum number of jobs any user may have  running  in  a
     Grid  Engine cluster at the same time. If set to 0 (default)
     the users may run  an  arbitrary  number  of  jobs.  If  the
     user_sort  scheduling  policy  is  active  (see  below)  the
     scheduler allows at the most maxujobs in each priority group

     The maxujobs parameter has no effect in a Grid Engine Enter-
     prise  Edition  system.  Grid Engine Enterprise Edition pro-
     vides more sophisticated means to control share entitlement.

  maxgjobs
     Not implemented yet. Provided for later extension.

  schedule_interval
     At   the   time   <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_schedd.html">sge_schedd(8)</A></B>   initially   registers   to
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>  schedule_interval  is  used  to set the time
     interval in  which  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>  sends  scheduling  event
     updates  to  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_schedd.html">sge_schedd(8)</A></B>.   A scheduling event is a status
     change that has occurred  within  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>  which  may
     trigger  or  affect scheduler decisions (e.g. a job has fin-
     ished and thus the allocated resources are available again).
     In the Grid  Engine  default  scheduler  the  arrival  of  a
     scheduling  event  report  triggers  a  scheduler  run.  The
     scheduler waits for event reports otherwise.
     Schedule_interval is a time value (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>  for  a
     definition of the syntax of time values).

  user_sort
     Grid Engine usually schedules user jobs corresponding  to  a
     first-come-first-served  policy.  In  case  a user submits a
     large amount of jobs in very short time, this can lead to  a
     rather unfair situation, because all users submitting after-
     wards are blocked until most of the first  user's  jobs  are
     completed.   Therefore,  Grid  Engine  allows to change this
     policy to the so called equal share sort: As soon as a  user
     has  a  job  running his other jobs are sorted to the end of
     the pending jobs list. Thus, the first  jobs  of  all  other
     users  have  comparable  chances  to find a queue. Note: The
     equal share sort only applies within the same  job  priority
     category  (refer  to  the  <I>mp</I>  option  of  the  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>  and
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qalter.html">qalter(1)</A></B> commands for more information).

     The default for user_sort is FALSE.

  queue_sort_method
     This parameter determines in which  order  several  criteria
     are  taken  into  account  to  product  a sorted queue list.
     Currently, two settings are valid:  seqno and load.  However
     in  both  cases, Grid Engine attempts to maximize the number
     of soft requests (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> -s option) being fulfilled  by
     the queues for a particular as the primary criterion.
     Then, if the queue_sort_method parameter is  set  to  seqno,
     Grid  Engine  will use the seq_no parameter as configured in
     the current queue configurations (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>) as  the
     next criterion to sort the queue list. The load_formula (see
     above) has only a meaning if two queues have equal  sequence
     numbers.   If  queue_sort_method  is  set  to  load the load
     according the load_formula is the criterion after maximizing
     a  job's  soft requests and the sequence number is only used
     if two hosts have the same load.  The sequence number  sort-
     ing  is  most  useful if you want to define a fixed order in
     which queues are to be filled (e.g.   the cheapest  resource
     first).

     The default for this parameter is load.

  sgeee_schedule_interval
     This parameter is only available in a Grid Engine Enterprise
     Edition system. Grid Engine does not support this parameter.

     The time period between job priority adjustments by the Grid
     Engine  Enterprise  Edition  global dynamic scheduler (GDS).
     Valid values are specified of  type  time  as  specified  in
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>.

  halftime
     This parameter is only available in a Grid Engine Enterprise
     Edition system. Grid Engine does not support this parameter.

     When executing under  a  share  based  policy,  Grid  Engine
     Enterprise  Edition  "ages" (i.e. decreases) usage to imple-
     ment a sliding window for achieving the  share  entitlements
     as  defined by the share tree. The halftime defines the time
     interval in which accumulated usage will have  been  decayed
     to  half  its  original value. Valid values are specified of
     type time as specified in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>.

  usage_weight_list
     This parameter is only available in a Grid Engine Enterprise
     Edition system. Grid Engine does not support this parameter.

     Grid Engine Enterprise Edition accounts for the  consumption
     of  the  resources  CPU-time, memory and IO to determine the
     usage which is imposed on a system by a job. A single  usage
     value  is computed from these three input parameters by mul-
     tiplying the individual values by weights  and  adding  them
     up.  The  weights  are defined in the usage_weight_list. The
     format of the list is

          cpu=wcpu,mem=wmem,io=wio

     where wcpu, wmem and wio are the configurable  weights.  The
     weights  are real number. The sum of all tree weights should
     be 1.

  compensation_factor
     This parameter is only available in a Grid Engine Enterprise
     Edition system. Grid Engine does not support this parameter.
     Determines how fast Grid Engine  Enterprise  Edition  should
     compensate  for past usage below of above the share entitle-
     ment defined in  the  share  tree.  Recommended  values  are
     between 2 and 10, where 10 means faster compensation.

  weight_user
     This parameter is only available in a Grid Engine Enterprise
     Edition system. Grid Engine does not support this parameter.

     The relative importance of the user shares in the functional
     policy.  Values are of type real.

  weight_project
     This parameter is only available in a Grid Engine Enterprise
     Edition system. Grid Engine does not support this parameter.

     The relative importance of the project shares in  the  func-
     tional policy.  Values are of type real.

  weight_jobclass
     This parameter is only available in a Grid Engine Enterprise
     Edition system. Grid Engine does not support this parameter.

     The relative importance of the job class (i.e. queue) shares
     in the functional policy. Values are of type real.

  weight_department
     This parameter is only available in a Grid Engine Enterprise
     Edition system. Grid Engine does not support this parameter.

     The relative importance of  the  department  shares  in  the
     functional policy. Values are of type real.

  weight_job
     This parameter is only available in a Grid Engine Enterprise
     Edition system. Grid Engine does not support this parameter.

     The relative importance of the job shares in the  functional
     policy. Values are of type real.

  weight_tickets_functional
     This parameter is only available in a Grid Engine Enterprise
     Edition system. Grid Engine does not support this parameter.

     The maximum number of functional tickets available for  dis-
     tribution  by Grid Engine Enterprise Edition. Determines the
     relative importance of the functional policy.

  weight_tickets_share
     This parameter is only available in a Grid Engine Enterprise
     Edition system. Grid Engine does not support this parameter.

     The maximum number of share based tickets available for dis-
     tribution  by Grid Engine Enterprise Edition. Determines the
     relative importance of the share tree policy.

  weight_deadline
     This parameter is only available in a Grid Engine Enterprise
     Edition system. Grid Engine does not support this parameter.

     The maximum number of deadline tickets available for distri-
     bution  by  Grid  Engine  Enterprise Edition. Determines the
     relative importance of the deadline policy.

  schedd_job_info
     The default scheduler can keep track why jobs could  not  be
     scheduled  during  the  last  scheduler  run. This parameter
     enables or disables the observation.  The value true enables
     the monitoring false turns it off.

     It is also possible to activate  the  observation  only  for
     certain  jobs.  This will be done if the parameter is set to
     job_list followed by a comma separated list of job ids.

     The user can obtain the collected information with the  com-
     mand qstat -j.
