NAME
     sge_h_aliases - Grid Engine host aliases file format

DESCRIPTION
     All Grid Engine components use a hostname resolving  service
     provided  by  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_commd.html">sge_commd(8)</A></B>  to  identify  hosts via a unique
     hostname.   <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_commd.html">sge_commd(8)</A></B>  itself  references  standard  UNIX
     directory  services  such  as  DNS,  NIS  and  /etc/hosts to
     resolve hostnames. In rare  cases  these  standard  services
     cannot  be  setup cleanly and Grid Engine communication dae-
     mons running on different hosts are unable to  automatically
     determine  a  unique hostname for one or all hosts which can
     be used on all hosts. In such situations a Grid Engine  host
     aliases  file  can be used to provide the communication dae-
     mons with a private and consistent hostname resolution data-
     base.

     The  default  location  for  the  host   aliases   file   is
     &lt;<I>sge</I>_<I>root</I>&gt;/&lt;<I>cell</I>&gt;/<I>common</I>/<I>host</I>_<I>aliases</I>.   To  use a different
     host  aliases,  it   must   be   specified   explicitly   to
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_commd.html">sge_commd(8)</A></B> via the -a command line option.

FORMAT
     For each host a single line must be provided with  a  blank,
     comma  or  semicolon separated list of hostname aliases. The
     first alias is defined to be the unique hostname which  will
     be  used  by  all  Grid Engine components using the hostname
     aliasing service of the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_commd.html">sge_commd(8)</A></B>.
