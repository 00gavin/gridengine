NAME
     reporting - Grid Engine reporting file format

DESCRIPTION
     A  Grid  Engine  system   writes   a   reporting   file   to
     $SGE_ROOT/default/common/reporting.  The reporting file con-
     tains data that can be used for accounting,  monitoring  and
     analysis  purposes.  It contains information about the clus-
     ter (hosts, queues, load values, consumables,  etc.),  about
     the  jobs  running in the cluster and about sharetree confi-
     guration and usage.  All information is time related, events
     are dumped to the reporting file in a configurable interval.
     It allows to monitor a "real time" status of the cluster  as
     well as historical analysis.

FORMAT
     The reporting file is an ASCII file.  Eachline contains  one
     record,  the fields of a record are separated by a delimiter
     (:).  The reporting file contains records of different type.
     Each record type has a specific record structure.

     The first two fields are common to all reporting records:

     time Time (GMT unix timestamp) when the record was created.

     record type
          Type of the accounting record.  The different types  of
          records  and  their structure are described in the fol-
          lowing text.

new_job
     The new_job record is written whenever a new job enters  the
     system (usually by a submitting command). It has the follow-
     ing fields:

     submission_time
          Time when the job was submitted.

     job_number
          The job number.

     task_number
          The array task id. Always has the value -1 for  new_job
          records (as we don't have array tasks yet).

     pe_taskid
          The task id of parallel tasks.  Always  has  the  value
          "none" for new_job records.

     job_name
          The job name (from -N submission option)

     owner
          The job owner.

     group
          The unix group of the job owner.

     project
          The project the job is running in.

     department
          The department the job owner is in.

     account
          The account string specified for the job (from -A  sub-
          mission option).

     priority
          The job priority (from -p submission option).

job_log
     The job_log record is written whenever a job, an array  task
     or a pe tasks is changing status. A status change can be the
     transition from pending to running, but can  also  be  trig-
     gered  by user actions like suspension of a job.  It has the
     following fields:

     event_time
          Time (GMT unix time stamp)  when  the  event  was  gen-
          erated.

     event
          A one word description of the event.

     job_number
          The job number.

     task_number
          The array task id. Always has the value -1 for  new_job
          records (as we don't have array tasks yet).

     pe_taskid
          The task id of parallel tasks.  Always  has  the  value
          "none" for new_job records.

     state
          The state of the job after the event was processed.

     user The user who initiated the event (or special  usernames
          "qmaster",  "scheduler"  and "execd" for actions of the
          system itself  like  scheduling  jobs,  executing  jobs
          etc.).

     host The host from which the action was initiated (e.g.  the
          submit host, the qmaster host, etc.).

     state_time
          Reserved field for later use.

     submission_time
          Time when the job was submitted.

     job_name
          The job name (from -N submission option)

     owner
          The job owner.

     group
          The unix group of the job owner.

     project
          The project the job is running in.

     department
          The department the job owner is in.

     account
          The account string specified for the job (from -A  sub-
          mission option).

     priority
          The job priority (from -p submission option).

     message
          A message describing the reported action.

acct
     Records of type acct are accounting records. They are  writ-
     ten  whenever a job, a task of an array job or the task of a
     parallel job terminates.  Accounting  records  comprise  the
     following fields:

     qname
          Name of the cluster queue in which the job has run.

     hostname
          Name of the execution host.

     group
          The effective group id of the job owner when  executing
          the job.

     owner
          Owner of the Grid Engine job.

     job_name
          Job name.

     job_number
          Job identifier - job number.

     account
          An account  string  as  specified  by  the  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>  or
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qalter.html">qalter(1)</A></B> -A option.

     priority
          Priority value assigned to the job corresponding to the
          priority  parameter  in  the  queue  configuration (see
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>).

     submission_time
          Submission time in seconds (since epoch format).

     start_time
          Start time in seconds (since epoch format).

     end_time
          End time in seconds (since epoch format).

     failed
          Indicates the problem which  occurred  in  case  a  job
          could  not  be  started  on  the  execution  host (e.g.
          because the owner of the  job  did  not  have  a  valid
          account on that machine). If Grid Engine tries to start
          a job multiple times, this may lead to multiple entries
          in  the  accounting  file corresponding to the same job
          ID.

     exit_status
          Exit status of the job script (or Grid Engine  specific
          status in case of certain error conditions).

     ru_wallclock
          Difference between end_time and start_time (see above).

     The remainder of the accounting entries follows the contents
     of  the  standard  UNIX  rusage  structure  as  described in
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman2/getrusage.html">getrusage(2)</A></B>.  Depending on the operating system  where  the
     job was executed some of the fields may be 0.  The following
     entries are provided:
