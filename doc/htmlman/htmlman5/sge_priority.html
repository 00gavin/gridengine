NAME
     sge_priority - Grid Engine job priorities

DESCRIPTION
     The SGE_PRIORITY man page describes means in Grid Engine for
     controlling job priorities.

     Grid Engine provide means for controlling job  dispatch  and
     run-time  priorities.  The  dispatch  priority  is about the
     importance of pending jobs  compared  with  each  other  and
     determines the order in which Grid Engine dispatches jobs to
     queues instances. The run-time priority is about the operat-
     ing  system  priorities  of running jobs that influences the
     CPU allocation which the operating system assigns to jobs.

  JOBS DISPATCH PRIORITY
     A job's dispatch priority is affected by the job's <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/submit.html?pathrev=V60_BRANCH">submit(1)</A></B>
     -p priority, the job's submit time and on the policy set-up.
     The overall dispatch priority set-up specifies how  priority
     values  ("prio")  of  jobs are dynamically computed and they
     are derived from the ticket policy and the  urgency  policy.
     The     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sched_conf.html?pathrev=V60_BRANCH">sched_conf(5)</A></B>     parameters    weight_ticket    and
     weight_urgency are used to control to what degree the ticket
     policy  resp.  urgency policy shall be in effect. To facili-
     tate  easier  control,  the  dynamically  determined  values
     ("tckts"/"urg")    for    both   policies   are   normalized
     ("ntckts"/"nurg") before they  are  used  to  calculate  job
     priorities ("prio"):

        prio    = nurg * weight_urgency + weight_ticket * ntckts
        nurg    = normalized(urg)
        ntckts  = normalized(tckts)

     Normalizing maps the available urgency/ticket values into  a
     range  between  0 and 1.  The higher a jobs dynamic priority
     value the earlier it gets an assignment.

     The urgency policy defines an urgency value  for  each  job.
     The urgency value

        urg     =  rrcontr + wtcontr + dlcontr

     consists   of   the   resource   requirement    contribution
     ("rrcontr"),  the  waiting time contribution ("wtcontr") and
     the deadline contribution ("dlcontr").

     The resource  requirement  contribution  is  adding  up  all
     resource requirements of a job into a single numeric value.

        rrcontr = Sum over all(hrr)

     with an "hrr" for each hard resource request.  Depending  on
     the  resource  type two different methods are used to deter-
     mine the value to be used for "hrr" here. For  numeric  type
     resource  requests  the  "hrr"  representes  how  much  of a
     resource a job requests (on a per-slot basis and on how many
     slots)  and  how  "important" this resource is considered in
     comparison to other resources. This is expressed by the for-
     mula:

        hrr      = rurg * assumed_slot_allocation * request

     with the resources urgency value ("rurg") as specified under
     urgency  in  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html?pathrev=V60_BRANCH">complex(5)</A></B>,  the  job's assumed_slot_allocation
     representing the number of slots a job supposedly  gets  and
     the  per  slot  request  as  specified  using the -l <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V60_BRANCH">qsub(1)</A></B>
     option. For string type requests the formula is simply

        hrr      = "rurg"

     and directly assigns the resource urgency value as specified
     under urgency in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html?pathrev=V60_BRANCH">complex(5)</A></B>.

     The waiting time contribution represents a weighted  weight-
     ing time of the jobs

        wtcontr = waiting_time * waiting_weight

     with the waiting time  in  seconds  and  the  waiting_weight
     value as specified in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sched_conf.html?pathrev=V60_BRANCH">sched_conf(5)</A></B>.

     The deadline contribution has an increasing effect  as  jobs
     approach  their deadline initiation time (see the -dl option
     in  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html?pathrev=V60_BRANCH">qsub(1)</A></B>).   It  is  defined  as  the  quotient  of   the
     weight_deadline  value  from <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sched_conf.html?pathrev=V60_BRANCH">sched_conf(5)</A></B> and the (steadily
     decreasing) free time in seconds until  deadline  initiation
     time

        dlcontr = wheight_deadline / free_time

     or is set to 0 for non-deadline jobs.

     The ticket policy unites functional, override and share tree
     policies  in the ticket value ("tckts") being defined as the
     sum of the specific ticket values  ("ftckt"/"otckt"/"stckt")
     for each sub-policy

         tckts = ftckt + otckt + stckt

     The ticket policies provide  a  broad  range  of  means  for
     influencing  both  job  dispatch and runtime priorities on a
     per job, per user, per project, and  per  department  basis.
     See  the  Grid  Engine Installation and Administration Guide
     for details.

  JOB RUN-TIME PRIORITY
     The run-time priority can be dynamically adjusted  in  order
     to  meet  the goals set with the ticket policy. Dynamic run-
     time priority adjustment can be turned  off  (default)  glo-
     bally  using  reprioritize_interval  in  <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sched_conf.html?pathrev=V60_BRANCH">sched_conf(5)</A></B> If no
     dynamic run-time priority  adjustment  is  done  at  a  host
     level,  the  priority  specification  in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html?pathrev=V60_BRANCH">queue_conf(5)</A></B> is in
     effect.
