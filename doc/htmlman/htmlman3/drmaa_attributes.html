     drmaa_get_attribute_names, drmaa_get_vector_attribute_names,
     drmaa_get_next_attr_name,  drmaa_release_attr_names  - DRMAA
     job template attributes

SYNOPSIS
     #include "drmaa.h"

     int drmaa_get_attribute_names(
          drmaa_attr_names_t **values,
          char *error_diagnosis,
          size_t error_diag_len
     );

     int drmaa_get_vector_attribute_names(
          drmaa_attr_names_t **values,
          char *error_diagnosis,
          size_t error_diag_len
     );

     int drmaa_get_next_attr_name(
          drmaa_attr_names_t* values,
          char *value,
          int value_len

     void drmaa_release_attr_names(
          drmaa_attr_names_t* values
     );

DESCRIPTION
     The drmaa_get_attribute_names() function returns into <I>values</I>
     a  DRMAA names string vector containing the set of supported
     non-vector DRMAA  job  template  attribute  names.  The  set
     includes  supported  DRMAA reserved attribute names and Grid
     Engine native attribute names. The names in the names string
     vector  can  be extracted using <B><A HREF="../htmlman3/drmaa_get_next_attr_name.html">drmaa_get_next_attr_name(3)</A></B>.
     The caller is responsible for  releasing  the  names  string
     vector        returned        into        <I>values</I>       using
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman3/drmaa_release_attr_names.html">drmaa_release_attr_names(3)</A></B>.  Use <B><A HREF="../htmlman3/drmaa_set_attribute.html">drmaa_set_attribute(3)</A></B> and
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman3/drmaa_get_attribute.html">drmaa_get_attribute(3)</A></B> for setting and inspecting non-vector
     attributes.

  drmaa_get_vector_attribute_names()
     The drmaa_get_vector_attribute_names() function returns into
     <I>values</I>  a  DRMAA  names  string vector containing the set of
     supported vector DRMAA job template attribute names. The set
     includes  supported  DRMAA reserved attribute names and Grid
     Engine native attribute names. The names in the names string
     vector  can  be extracted using <B><A HREF="../htmlman3/drmaa_get_next_attr_name.html">drmaa_get_next_attr_name(3)</A></B>.
     The caller is responsible for  releasing  the  names  string
     vector        returned        into        <I>values</I>       using
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman3/drmaa_release_attr_names.html">drmaa_release_attr_names(3)</A></B>.                             Use
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman3/drmaa_set_vector_attribute.html">drmaa_set_vector_attribute(3)</A></B>                            and
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman3/drmaa_get_vector_attribute.html">drmaa_get_vector_attribute(3)</A></B>  for  setting  and  inspecting
     vector attributes.

  drmaa_get_next_attr_name()
     Each time drmaa_get_next_attr_name() is  called  it  returns
     into  the  buffer  <I>value</I>  up  to <I>value</I>_<I>len</I> bytes of the next
     entry stored in the DRMAA names string vector <I>values</I>.

  drmaa_release_attr_names()
     The   drmaa_release_attr_names()   function   releases   all
     resources  associated  with  the  DRMAA  names string vector
     <I>values</I>.

DRMAA JOB TEMPLATE ATTRIBUTES
  drmaa_remote_command - "&lt;remote_command&gt;"
     Specifies the remote command to execute. The  <I>remote</I>_<I>command</I>
     must  be  the path of an executable that is available at the
     jobs execution host.

  drmaa_js_state - "{drmaa_hold|drmaa_active}"
     Specifies the job state  at  submission.  As  string  values
     `drmaa_hold'   and   `drmaa_active'   are   supported.  When
     `drmaa_active' setting is used the  job  is  runnable.  When
     `drmaa_hold'  setting  is  used the job is submitted in user
     hold     state     (either     DRMAA_PS_USER_ON_HOLD      or
     DRMAA_PS_USER_SYSTEM_ON_HOLD). This is equivalent to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>
     submit option `-h'.

  drmaa_wd - "&lt;directory_name&gt;"
     Specifies the directory name where the job will be executed.
     A `$drmaa_hd_ph$' placeholder at the begin of <I>directory</I>_<I>name</I>
     denotes the remaining string portion as a relative directory
     name  that is resolved relative to the job users home direc-
     tory at the execution host. When the DRMAA job template will
     be    used    for    bulk    job    submission   (see   also
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman3/drmaa_run_bulk_job.html">drmaa_run_bulk_job(3)</A></B>) the `$drmaa_incr_ph$' placeholder can
     be  used  at  any  position within <I>directory</I>_<I>name</I> to cause a
     substitution   with   the   parametric   jobs   index.   The
     <I>directory</I>_<I>name</I>  must be specified in a syntax that is common
     at the host where the job is executed. If set and no  place-
     holder  is  used  an  absolute  directory  specification  is
     expected. If set and the directory does not  exist  the  job
     enters the state DRMAA_PS_FAILED.

  drmaa_job_name - "&lt;job_name&gt;"
     Specifies the jobs name. Setting the job name is  equivalent
     to use of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> submit option `-N' with <I>job</I>_<I>name</I> as option
     argument.


  drmaa_input_path - "[&lt;hostname&gt;]:&lt;file_path&gt;"
     Specifies the standard input of the job.  Unless  set  else-
     where, if not explicitly set in the job template, the job is
     started with an empty input stream. If the standard input is
     set  it  specifies the network path of the jobs input stream
     file.

     When the `drmaa_transfer_files' job  template  attribute  is
     supported  and  contains  the  character `i', the input file
     will be fetched by Grid Engine from the  specified  host  or
     from  the  submit host if no <I>hostname</I> is specified. When the
     `drmaa_transfer_files' job template attribute  is  not  sup-
     ported or does not contain the character `i', the input file
     is always expected at the host where  the  job  is  executed
     irrespectively of a possibly <I>hostname</I> specified.

     If the DRMAA job template will be used for of bulk job  sub-
     mission     (see     also     <B><A HREF="../htmlman3/drmaa_run_bulk_job.html">drmaa_run_bulk_job(3)</A></B>)     the
     `$drmaa_incr_ph$' placeholder can be used  at  any  position
     within <I>file</I>_<I>path</I> to cause a substitution with the parametric
     jobs index. A `$drmaa_hd_ph$' placeholder at  the  begin  of
     <I>file</I>_<I>path</I>  denotes the remaining portion of the <I>file</I>_<I>path</I> as
     a relative file specification resolved relative to  the  job
     users  home directory at the host where the file is located.
     A `$drmaa_wd_ph$' placeholder  at  the  begin  of  <I>file</I>_<I>path</I>
     denotes the remaining portion of the <I>file</I>_<I>path</I> as a relative
     file specification resolved relative  to  the  jobs  working
     directory  at  the  host  where  the  file  is  located. The
     <I>file</I>_<I>path</I> must be specified in a syntax that  is  common  at
     the  host  where  the  file  is located. If set and the file
     can't be read the job enters the state DRMAA_PS_FAILED.

  drmaa_output_path - "[&lt;hostname&gt;]:&lt;file_path&gt;"
     Specifies the standard output of the job. If not  explicitly
     set  in the job template, the whereabouts of the jobs output
     stream is not defined. If set specifies the network path  of
     the jobs output stream file.

     When the `drmaa_transfer_files' job  template  attribute  is
     supported  and  contains  the character 'o', the output file
     will be transferred by Grid Engine to the specified host  or
     to  the  submit  host  if no <I>hostname</I> is specified. When the
     `drmaa_transfer_files' job template attribute  is  not  sup-
     ported  or  does  not  contain the character 'o', the output
     file is always kept at the host where the  job  is  executed
     irrespectively of a possibly <I>hostname</I> specified.

     If the DRMAA job template will be used for of bulk job  sub-
     mission     (see     also     <B><A HREF="../htmlman3/drmaa_run_bulk_job.html">drmaa_run_bulk_job(3)</A></B>)     the
     `$drmaa_incr_ph$' placeholder can be used  at  any  position
     within  the  <I>file</I>_<I>path</I>  to  cause  a  substitution  with the
     parametric jobs index. A `$drmaa_hd_ph$' placeholder at  the
     begin  of  <I>file</I>_<I>path</I>  denotes  the  remaining portion of the
     <I>file</I>_<I>path</I> as a relative file specification resolved relative
     to  the  job users home directory at the host where the file
     is located. A `$drmaa_wd_ph$' placeholder at  the  begin  of
     the  <I>file</I>_<I>path</I> denotes the remaining portion of <I>file</I>_<I>path</I> as
     a relative file specification resolved relative to the  jobs
     working directory at the host where the file is located. The
     <I>file</I>_<I>path</I> must be specified in a syntax that  is  common  at
     the  host  where  the  file  is located. If set and the file
     can't be written before execution the job enters  the  state
     DRMAA_PS_FAILED.

  drmaa_error_path - "[&lt;hostname&gt;]:&lt;file_path&gt;"
     Specifies the standard error of the job. If  not  explicitly
     set  in  the job template, the whereabouts of the jobs error
     stream is not defined. If set, specifies the network path of
     the jobs error stream file.

     When the `drmaa_transfer_files' job  template  attribute  is
     supported  and  contains  the character 'e', the output file
     will be transferred by Grid Engine to the specified host  or
     to  the  submit  host  if no <I>hostname</I> is specified. When the
     `drmaa_transfer_files' job template attribute  is  not  sup-
     ported or does not contain the character 'e', the error file
     is always kept  at  the  host  where  the  job  is  executed
     irrespectively of a possibly <I>hostname</I> specified.

     If the DRMAA job template will be used for of bulk job  sub-
     mission     (see     also     <B><A HREF="../htmlman3/drmaa_run_bulk_job.html">drmaa_run_bulk_job(3)</A></B>)     the
     `$drmaa_incr_ph$' placeholder can be used  at  any  position
     within  the  <I>file</I>_<I>path</I>  to  cause  a  substitution  with the
     parametric jobs index. A `$drmaa_hd_ph$' placeholder at  the
     begin  of the <I>file</I>_<I>path</I> denotes the remaining portion of the
     <I>file</I>_<I>path</I> as a relative file specification resolved relative
     to  the  job users home directory at the host where the file
     is located. A `$drmaa_wd_ph$' placeholder at  the  begin  of
     the <I>file</I>_<I>path</I> denotes the remaining portion of the <I>file</I>_<I>path</I>
     as a relative file specification resolved  relative  to  the
     jobs  working  directory  at  the  host  where  the  file is
     located. The <I>file</I>_<I>path</I> must be specified in a syntax that is
     common at the host where the file is located. If set and the
     file can't be written before execution the  job  enters  the
     state     DRMAA_PS_FAILED.    The    attribute    name    is
     drmaa_error_path.


  drmaa_join_files - "{y|n}"
     Specifies if the jobs error stream should be intermixed with
     the output stream. If not explicitly set in the job template
     the attribute defaults to `n'. Either  `y'  or  `n'  can  be
     specified.  If  `y' is specified Grid Engine will ignore the
     value of the `drmaa_error_path' job template  attribute  and
     intermix  the standard error stream with the standard output
     stream as specified with `drmaa_output_path'.

  drmaa_v_argv - "argv1 argv2 ..."
     Specifies the arguments to the job.

  drmaa_job_category - "&lt;category&gt;"
     Specifies the DRMAA job category. The <I>category</I>  string  will
     presumably  be  used  by  Grid  Engine as reference into the
     <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/qtask.html">qtask(5)</A></B> file. Certain <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> options used  in  the  refer-
     enced qtask file line are applied to the job template before
     submission to allow  site-specific  resolving  of  resources
     and/or  policies.  Both  the cluster qtask file and the user
     qtask file are searched. Job  settings  resulting  from  job
     template  category  can  be overridden by settings resulting
     from job template `drmaa_native_specification' as well as by
     explict DRMAA job template settings. Not yet implemented.

  drmaa_native_specification - "&lt;native_specification&gt;"
     Specifies Grid Engine native specification. Presumably  cer-
     tain  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>  options  containedin the <I>native</I>_<I>specification</I>
     are applied to the job template before job  submission.  Job
     settings resulting from native specification can be overrid-
     den with explict DRMAA job template settings. Not yet imple-
     mented.

  drmaa_v_env - "&lt;name1&gt;=&lt;value1&gt; &lt;name2&gt;=&lt;value2&gt; ...
     Specifies  the  job  environment.  Each  environment   <I>value</I>
     defines  the  remote  environment.  The  <I>value</I> overrides the
     remote environment values if there is a collision.  Not  yet
     implemented.

  drmaa_v_email - "&lt;email1&gt; &lt;email2&gt; ...
     Specifies e-mail adresses that are used to  report  the  job
     completion and status. Not yet implemented.

  drmaa_block_email - "{0|1}"
     Specifies whether e-mail sending shall blocked or  not.  Not
     yet implemented.

  drmaa_start_time - "[[[[CC]YY/]MM/]DD] hh:mm[:ss] [{-|+}UU:uu]"
     Specifies the earliest time when the job may be eligible  to
     be run where

          CC is the first two digits of the year (century-1)
          YY is the last two digits of the year
          MM is the two digits of the month [01,12]
          DD is the two digit day of the month [01,31]
          hh is the two digit hour of the day [00,23]
          mm is the two digit minute of the day [00,59]
          ss is the two digit second of the minute [00,61]
          UU is the two digit hours since (before) UTC
          uu is the two digit minutes since (before) UTC

     If the optional UTC-offset  is  not  specified,  the  offset
     associated  with the local timezone will be used. If the day
     (DD) is not specified, the current day will be  used  unless
     the  specified hour:mm:ss has already elapsed, in which case
     the next day will be used. Similarly for  month  (MM),  year
     (YY),  and  century-1 (CC). Example: The time: Sep 3 4:47:27
     PM PDT 2002, could be represented  as:  2002/09/03  16:47:27
     -07:00.  Not yet implemented.
      .PP

ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
     SGE_ROOT       Specifies the location  of  the  Grid  Engine
                    standard configuration files.

     SGE_CELL       If set, specifies  the  default  Grid  Engine
                    cell  to  be  used.  To address a Grid Engine
                    cell Grid Engine uses (in the order  of  pre-
                    cedence):

                         The name of the cell  specified  in  the
                         environment  variable SGE_CELL, if it is
                         set.

                         The  name  of  the  default  cell,  i.e.
                         default.


     SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL
                    If  set,  specifies  that  debug  information
                    should  be written to stderr. In addition the
                    level of detail in which debug information is
                    generated is defined.

     COMMD_PORT     If set,  specifies  the  tcp  port  on  which
                    <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_commd.html">sge_commd(8)</A></B>  is  expected to listen for com-
                    munication requests.  Most installations will
                    use  a  services  map entry instead to define
                    that port.

RETURN VALUES
     Upon  successful  completion,   drmaa_get_attribute_names(),
     drmaa_get_vector_attribute_names(),                      and
     drmaa_get_next_attr_name() return DRMAA_ERRNO_SUCCESS. Other
     values  indicate  an error.  Up to <I>error</I>_<I>diag</I>_<I>len</I> characters
     of error related diagnosis information is then  provided  in
     the buffer <I>error</I>_<I>diagnosis</I>.

ERRORS
     The                             drmaa_get_attribute_names(),
     drmaa_get_vector_attribute_names(),                      and
     drmaa_get_next_attr_name() functions will fail if:

  DRMAA_ERRNO_INTERNAL_ERROR
     Unexpected or internal DRMAA error like system call failure,
     etc.

  DRMAA_ERRNO_DRM_COMMUNICATION_FAILURE
     Could not contact DRM system for this request.

  DRMAA_ERRNO_AUTH_FAILURE
     The specified request is not processed successfully  due  to
     authorization failure.

  DRMAA_ERRNO_INVALID_ARGUMENT
     The input value for an argument is invalid.

  DRMAA_ERRNO_NO_ACTIVE_SESSION
     Failed because there is no active session.

  DRMAA_ERRNO_NO_MEMORY
     Failed allocating memory.

     The drmaa_get_next_attr_name() will fail if:

  DRMAA_ERRNO_INVALID_ATTRIBUTE_VALUE
     When there are no more entries in the vector.
