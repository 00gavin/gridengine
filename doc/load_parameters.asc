                      Default Load Parameters
                      -----------------------

                  (c) 2001 Sun Microsystems, Inc.


The load parameters reported by the execution daemon per default currently
are:

arch            : An architecture string compiled into the cod_execd
                  describing the operating system architecture for which
                  the execd is targeted. Possible values are:

                        solaris    for SUN Solaris 2.6, 7, 8 32 bit kernel
                        solaris64  for SUN Solaris 7, 8 with 64 bit kernel
                        irix6      for SGI IRIX 6.2-6.5
                        osf4       for Digital UNIX version 4.x
                        tru64      for Compaq Tru64 Unix 5.x
                        hp10       for HP-UX 10.x
                        hp11       for HP-UX 11.x
                        aix42      for IBM AIX 4.2
                        aix43      for IBM AIX 4.3
                        glinux     for Linux Intel libc6 2.1+ based
                        alinux     for Linux AXP
                        cray       for Cray Unicos
                        crayts     for Cray TS Unicos
                        craytsieee for Cray TS with IEEE hardware              
          
                  Note, that a cod_execd for a particular architecture may
                  run on multiple OS versions.  In this case, the
                  architecture string delivered by cod_execd may be
                  misleading.

num_proc        : The number of processors provided by the execution host.
                  The host is in this case defined by a single Internet
                  address, i.e. rack mounted multi host systems are counted
                  as a cluster rather than a single multi headed machine.

The following load information is NOT available under

  aix42, aix43 

load_short      : The short time average OS run queue length. It is the
                  first of the value triple reported by the uptime(1)
                  command. Many implementations provide a 1 minute average
                  with this value

load_medium     : The medium time average OS run queue length. It is the
                  second of the value triple reported by the uptime(1)
                  command. Many implementations provide a 5 minute average
                  with this value

load_long       : The long time average OS run queue length. It is the
                  third of the value triple reported by the uptime(1)
                  command. Many implementations provide a 10 or 15 minute
                  average with this value

load_avg        : The same as load_medium. It is provided for continuity
                  with CODINE 3.3.x.

np_load_short   : The same as load_short but divided by the number of
                  processors. This value allows to compare the load of
                  single and multi headed hosts.

np_load_medium  : The same as load_medium but divided by the number of
                  processors. This value allows to compare the load of
                  single and multi headed hosts.

np_load_long    : The same as load_long but divided by the number of
                  processors. This value allows to compare the load of
                  single and multi headed hosts.

np_load_avg     : The same as load_avg but divided by the number of
                  processors. This value allows to compare the load of
                  single and multi headed hosts.

cpu             : The percentage of CPU time not in idle state.


The following memory load information is only available under 

   solaris, solaris64, hp10, hp11, osf4, tru64, glinux, alinux, 
   irix6 (NOT aix42 and NOT aix43)

mem_free        : The amount of free memory. 
swap_free       : The amount of free swap memory.
virtual_free    : The sum of mem_free and swap_free.
mem_used        : The amount of used memory. 
swap_used       : The amount of used swap space.
virtual_used    : The sum of mem_used and swap_used.
mem_total       : The total amount of memory (free+used).
swap_total      : The total amount of swap space (free+used).
virtual_total   : The sum of mem_total and swap_total.


For detailed information on how to extend the default set of load
parameters, please refer to the "Load Paramters" section in the CODINE
Installation and Administration Guide.

Included below is a template for the host complex with the default
definitions for the default load parameters. To restore the host complex of
your CODINE system to these settings, please save the table to a file and
register it with the qconf -Mc command. For information concerning the
CODINE complexes concept and its relation to load parameters, please refer
to the section "The Complexes Concept" in the CODINE Installation and
Administration Guide.
