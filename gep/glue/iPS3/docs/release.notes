This code was modified from the previous version in two ways:

First, a dependency on home directory paths was removed.

Second, the environment variable windows have now been generalized to
allow whatever the users type to be directly inserted into the script that
TCP submits to SGE. Whereas previously the line Option=5, would be
added as an environment variable only (i.e. export Option=5). The line is 
now inserted verbatum. Hence it can be SGE variables, or additional
commands.
