/** <p>This class represents a remote job and its attributes.  It is used to
 * set up the environment for a job to be submitted.</p>
 * <h3>DRMMA Attributes</h3>
 * <p>DRMAA job template attributes can be set from six different sources.  In
 * order of precedence, from lowest to highest, there are: options
 * set by DRMAA automatically by default, options set in the sge_request file,
 * options set in the script file, options set by the jobCategory
 * property, options set by the nativeSpecification property, and
 * options set through other DRMAA attributes.</p>
 * <p>By default DRMAA sets four options for all jobs.  They are &quot;-w e&quot;,
 * &quot;-p 0&quot;, &quot;-b yes&quot;, and &quot;-shell no&quot;.  This means
 * that by default, unschedulable jobs cannot be submitted, all jobs will have
 * priority 0, all jobs will be treated as
 * binary, i.e. no scripts args will be parsed, and all jobs will be executed
 * without a wrapper shell.</p>
 * The sge_request file, found in the $SGE_ROOT/$SGE_CELL/common directory, may
 * contain options to be applied to all jobs.  See the sge_request(5) man page
 * for more information.</p>
 * <p>If the sge_request file contains &quot;-b no&quot; or if the
 * nativeSpecification attribute is set and contains &quot;-b no&quot;, the
 * script file will be parsed for in-line arguments. Otherwise, no scripts args
 * will be interpreted.  See the qsub(1) man page for more information.</p>
 * <p>If the jobCategory attribute is set, and the category it points to
 * exists in one of the qtask files, the options associated with that category
 * will be applied to the job template.  See the qtask(5) man page and the
 * jobCategory attribute accessors below for more information.</p>
 * <p>If the nativeSpecification attribute is set, all options contained therein
 * will be applied to the job template.  See the nativeSpecification accessors
 * below for more information.</p>
 * <p>Other DRMAA attributes will override any previous settings.  For example,
 * if the sge_request file contains &quot;-j y&quot;, but the joinFiles
 * attribute is set to <i>false</i>, the ultimate result is that the input and
 * output files will remain separate.</p>
 * <h3>Attribute Correlations</h3>
 * <p>The following DRMAA attributes correspond to the following qsub
 * options:</p>
 * <table>
 *  <tr><th>DRMAA Attribute</th><th>qsub Option</th></tr>
 *  <tr><td>remoteCommand</td><td>script file</td>
 *  <tr><td>args</td><td>script file arguments</td>
 *  <tr><td>jobSubmissionState = HOLD</td><td>-h</td>
 *  <tr><td>jobEnvironment</td><td>-v</td>
 *  <tr><td>workingDirectory</td><td>NONE</td>
 *  <tr><td>jobCategory</td><td>NONE</td>
 *  <tr><td>nativeSpecification</td><td>NONE</td>
 *  <tr><td>emailAddresses</td><td>-M</td>
 *  <tr><td>blockEmail = true</td><td>-m n</td>
 *  <tr><td>startTime</td><td>-a</td>
 *  <tr><td>jobName</td><td>-N</td>
 *  <tr><td>inputPath</td><td>-i</td>
 *  <tr><td>outputPath</td><td>-o</td>
 *  <tr><td>errorPath</td><td>-e</td>
 *  <tr><td>joinFiles</td><td>-j</td>
 *  <tr><td>transferFiles</td><td>NONE</td>
 * </table>
 * <p>The following attributes are unsupported by Grid Engine:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>deadlineTime</li>
 * <li>hardWallclockTimeLimit</li>
 * <li>softWallclockTimeLimit</li>
 * <li>hardRunDurationTimeLimit</li>
 * <li>softRunDurationTimeLimit</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>Using the accessors for any of these attributes will result in an
 * UnsupportedAttributeException being thrown.</p>
