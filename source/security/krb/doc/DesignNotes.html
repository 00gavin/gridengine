<h2>
Original Design Notes</h2>
Below you can find a summary of the original design. Grid Engine evolved
from Codine/GRD.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Here are the results of my trip to GENIAS on February 8-13, 1997.
<p>The February 8-13 trip to GENIAS proved to very valuable. Working closely
with Andre Alefeld of GENIAS, we were able to meet and exceed all of the
goals that I had established for the trip (see below). Andre had prepared
by studying Kerberos in order to have a good understanding of the problem
that we are trying to solve.
<br>GENIAS also provided access to other engineers when their various areas
of expertise were required.
<p>Here were my goals for the trip:
<ol>
<li>
Become familiar with the CODINE source code most likely to be affected
by the kerberization of GRD.</li>

<li>
Identify any potential problem areas for kerberizing GRD. This would include
identifying potential performance problems, identifying code which could
be difficult to kerberize, and determining the best method of introducing
kerberos calls into the code (#ifdefs, stub libraries, licensing - the
short term answer is likely different than the long term one).</li>

<li>
Get a better idea of the scope of the GRD kerberization effort. This would
also include an estimate of what Ken and I can reasonably expect to accomplish
in the near term.</li>
</ol>

<p><br>One of the most important accomplishments of the trip was getting
familiar with some of the security work which had already taken place at
GENIAS. A graduate student had implemented some security features into
the CODINE product. Many of the difficult problems of kerberizing GRD,
such as where in the code to place the appropriate security calls, were
addressed in this implementation. Although the security enhancements done
by the graduate student were not Kerberos-based, there were enough similarities
in the protocol and the design was such that this proved to be a very good
starting place for kerberizing GRD. It became clear that the existence
of this work was very significant, because of the complexity and problems
involved in kerberizing GRD. Thankfully, these problems were encountered
by the graduate student and it appears from our review of his design and
code that they were successfully solved with the aid and support of the
other GENIAS engineers and developers.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Problems with Kerberizing GRD</h2>
Once you have a good understanding of the basics of Kerberos and how the
API library works, it appears from the sample client/server code that it
would be very easy to kerberize an application. This is not really the
case. The sample code deals with an extremely simplistic client/server
application. It is very easy to kerberize a simple client/server application.
Unfortunately, most existing client/server applications aren't simple.
Many of the problems with kerberizing an application are not addressed
in this simple example code. For instance, a real server will likely have
multiple clients which must be tracked individually. This involves keeping
some internal data structures on a per-client basis which may or may not
exist in the application.
<p>Another difficult problem is that in an existing "real-life" server
application the communications protocol is likely implemented in a separate
layer than the application code. This insulates the application code from
having to deal with the specifics of the communication layer. This presents
some real difficulties in implementing security, because the security protocol
needs information from both levels.
<p>Another significant problem with kerberizing GRD deals with tracking
clients. In a typical client/server application using stream based sockets
to pass messages between the client and the server, the server would initially
authenticate the client either before or as part of the first message sent
from the client to the server. All communications (i.e. messages) between
the client and the server would then be encrypted using the secret session
key known only to the client and the server. The server associates messages
with the clients based on the socket the message is read from. If a message
comes across the socket, the server uses the secret key associated with
the client to decrypt the message. If the socket goes down, this indicates
that communications between the client and the server have been disrupted
and the server can clean up any data structures that the client had. The
design of CODINE/GRD introduces a different communication model. Instead
of maintaining a socket per client, GRD servers and clients communicate
through a set of services that are part of a communication library. The
client and server actually communicate through one or more communication
daemons which dynamically manage socket connections. This insulates the
application from the details of socket management and handles various problems
associated with server communications such as buffering data and running
out of file descriptors. It also makes it difficult to know if a client
is up or down or reachable at a given time since there is no socket directly
associated with the client.
<p>One possible solution for handling the connectionless nature of CODINE/GRD
communications was to authenticate each individual message passed between
the client and the server. However, upon further investigation, this proved
to be an inadequate solution. One reason for this is that a simple transaction
consisting of a client sending a request to the server and getting back
the response generates two messages. One from the client to the server
and one from the server back to the client. It makes sense for the server
to authenticate the client, but the client should not have to explicitly
authenticate the server.
<p>Even a simple transaction has an implied state. A request is sent from
the client, the server performs some service on behalf of the client, and
a response is sent back to the client. Because the response is tied to
the request, there exists an implied state. The server must, at minimum,
authenticate the request, decrypt it, and encrypt the response back to
the client sufficiently that only the client can read the response. This
means that the server must at least maintain the state of the client internally
for the length of the transaction. An outgrowth of the design for handling
this case is that the server can actually handle additional messages from
the client without having to reauthenticate each message. Instead, each
message after the first is decrypted using the secret client/server session
key.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
GRD Kerberization Level of Effort Scope</h2>
There are at two levels of effort in Kerberizing GRD. The first level of
effort is the authentication of GRD clients and servers. It turns out that
the authentication of GRD clients and the authentication between the GRD
servers are both actually accomplished with the same design and code. The
basic design for this first level of effort was completed by Shannon Davidson
and Andre Alefeld as part of the February 8-13 trip to GENIAS. The second
level of effort in kerberizing GRD is the acquisition of Kerberos tickets
on behalf of the client's job on the execution host. This involves issues
such as acquiring ticket-granting-tickets on behalf of a client, handling/preventing
ticket expirations, storing tickets for future use, and forwarding tickets
to the execution host. There are also a number of design and performance
related issues associated with the second level of kerberizing GRD. Some
of these issues were identified during the February 8-13 trip, but the
actual design work has not yet been completed.
<h2>
GRD Kerberization - First Level of Effort</h2>
First Level Kerberization is handled by replacing the generic send_message
and receive_message routines in the commd library with kerberized versions.
The kerberized versions of the routines will maintain the state of the
connection and take care of the authentication of clients, as well as encrypting
and decrypting messages passed between clients and servers. Handling authentication
at this level means that any code using the standard commd library will
automatically have authentication. These routines will ensure that a user
is who he says he is. Higher level routines are responsible for determining
if that user is actually an authorized user of GRD. These routines will
behave differently when acting on behalf of a client or server. In this
model, the qmaster acts as the server, and all other CODINE/GRD daemons
and client programs act as clients. When acting as a server, these routines
will maintain a connection list which tracks the clients. When a client
first connects to a server, the client will be authenticated. If authentication
fails, a failure message will be sent back to the client indicating the
failure. If the client is not a CODINE/GRD daemon the failure message will
be displayed on the screen. If the client is successfully authenticated,
a connection entry will be created and added to the connection list. The
connection entry contains enough information to uniquely identify the client
based on information received in the receive_message routine. All later
messages received from or sent to this client will be encrypted. If the
connection is idle for a period of time (i.e. no messages sent or received
on the connection), the connection entry will be removed from the connection
list. A specific routine will be written which will check for connections
which have "timed-out" and "clean them up". This routine will be called
from the send_message and/or receive_message routines and may also be called
separately from within a chk_to_do routine in a CODINE/GRD daemon.

<h4>
Design Notes</h4>
Q. Is there a unique ID in the auth_context or available from the KDC which
could be used as the connection ID? It would need to be unique for every
client and also unique for each instantiation of a client. If there is
no unique ID that we can get from the KDC, then we may need to use a transaction
when authenticating the client in order to get back a connection ID from
the server.
<p>A.
<p>Q. Do we need to maintain an auth_context for each client?
<p>A. It appears that we need to maintain an auth_context for each client
for the life of the connection in the connection entry. The Kerberos libaries
maintain certain information such as the sequence number, etc. in this
data structure.
<p>Q. Why is there a connection ID?
<p>A. The connection ID is used to uniquely identify a client connection
by the server. Since the CODINE communication mechanism is basically connectionless
there is nothing like a socket to uniquely identify a client. A client
can be identified using the commd triple which consists of the host, process
name, and ID, but this would not be unique for cycled processes. The connection
ID can either be assigned by the KDC (if possible - see the first question)
or assigned by the server itself during the initial authentication process.
Assignment by the server guarrantees uniqueness of all clients regardless
<p>Q. Is there any way to avoid maintaining a connection list in the qmaster?
<p>A. It doesn't appear so. The connection list is needed so that the server
will know how to encrypt any messages going back from the server to the
client. The only way to make this association from with the sec_krb_send_message
routine is to map the parameters on the send_msg routine to a client in
the connection list and then use the auth_context from the connection entry
to encrypt the message.
<p>Q. What happens when the qmaster is cycled?
<p>A. The connection list is not spooled to disk, so when the qmaster is
cycled, all clients must reauthenticate. If the qmaster receives a message
from an unauthenticated client, the message will be thrown away and an
error message will be sent back to the client. (Would it make sense to
return the original offending message back to the client where it could
be retried?) This reauthentication could be handled in one of two ways.
The first method is that is a message ever fails then the client must reauthenticate
using an authentication transaction. The response of the authentication
request would contain the connection ID assigned by the server to the client.
Another possibility would be to include the reauthentication information
information (AP_REQ) in every message sent from the client to the server.
If the client was already authenticated in the server this portion of the
message would be ignored by the server. If the client was not already authenticated
by the server, he would be reauthenticated by the server. This would also
handle cases where messages destined for the qmaster are spooled in the
commd while the qmaster is down. Since each message would include authentication
info, the messages would not have to be thrown away when the qmaster comes
back up.
<p>Q. What happens when other CODINE/GRD deamons are cycled?
<p>A. When a CODINE/GRD daemon other than the qmaster is cycled and comes
back up, it will initially attempt to contact the qmaster. Any initial
message sent to the qmaster will include the authentication info (AP_REQ).
Any messages queued in the commd will be lost because they will have been
encrypted with an old session key. (Is this a problem?)
<p>Q. What happens when a client is cycled?
<p>A. Same as CODINE/GRD daemon.
<p>Q. Can the other CODINE/GRD deamons serve as server? This may be needed
for the plans that GENIAS has for enhanced parallel job support.
<p>A. We will look into this further during implementation. If possible,
we will construct the code such that any CODINE/GRD daemon can act as a
client if a message is received with the authentication information (AP_REQ)
attached.
<p>Q. If a client receives a message that it cannot decrypt what should
it do?
<p>A. If the client is a CODINE/GRD the message should be thrown away and
an error message logged. If the client is a general purpose client acting
on behalf of a user, an error message should be displayed to the user.
<p>Q. How do we make sure that the user doesn't authenticate himself to
the security routines and then simply indicate that he is someone else
to the higher level routines?
<p>A. The higher level routines (i.e. those which call receive_message)
need to call some security routine to verify that the user is who he says
he is. This is necessary because the higher level routines currently just
check the user ID which is passed in the message. This is not adequate
since a knowledgeable user could pass through the lower level security
routines as himself while putting a zero user ID into the message and passing
himself off as root in the higher level routines. There needs to be a test
in the higher level routines to verify that the user authenticated himself
as the same user that he indicated he was in the higher level message.
This would need to be done in the code which is calling the receive_message
routine. A routine needs to be written which verifies that the client is
a particular user. The routine could be called sec_krb_verify_client_user
and would be passed the user ID (or user name) and the commd triple &lt;host,
commproc, ID>. The routine would look up the user in the connection list,
compare to the passed user ID, and return true or false.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
GRD Kerberization - Second Level of Effort</h2>
Second level GRD kerberization will affect a number of different pieces
of code. It will probably involve changes in the job submittal client modules
(qsub, qmon4), the queue master (cod_qmaster), the execution daemon (cod_execd),
and possibly the job shepherd process (cod_shepherd). It will also mean
changes to, at a minimum, the job structure and the message data structures
used to pass job information between the various modules.
<p>A job submitted to GRD needs to have a TGT on the execution host. This
is necessary because certain applications that the job may need to access
(such as PVM) will need valid Kerberos tickets in order to work. A valid
TGT should be provided, since we don't know which services will be needed
by the job. A valid TGT on the execution host for the user of the job will
allow processes running under the job to get tickets for whatever services
the job requires.
<p>A number of steps are involved in order to get a valid TGT on the execution
host of the job. In general, a TGT is valid on a particular host or set
of hosts. (It is possible to get a TGT that is valid on any host in the
Kerberos domain, but this is not recommended.) First, the qsub or qmon4
client program gets a forwardable TGT for the host where the qmaster is
executing. This TGT is passed along with the job request to the qmaster.
The qmaster stores this TGT in the job entry. After the decision to run
the job on a particular host is made, the qmaster uses the TGT in the job
entry to acquire a TGT which is valid on the execution host and then passes
that TGT to the execution daemon along with the job request. The cod_execd
or the cod_shepherd then stores that TGT in the user's credentials cache
and starts the job. The job then has access to a valid TGT on the execution
host.
<p>A potential performance problem of getting a TGT on the execution host
of the job occurs when the cod_qmaster has to get a TGT which is valid
on the execution host. This is a problem because the cod_qmaster must contact
the KDC and wait for a response before it can send the job to the execution
host. If this transaction is executed synchronously, the qmaster will be
blocked for a period of time (maybe 100 ms average) for each job. This
should certainly be avoided if possible. One option would be to use an
asynchronous request, but this has the disadvantage of significantly complicating
the code due to handling the asynchronous request and having an additional
job state (i.e. WAITING_FOR_TGT) for each outstanding job. We would also
have to investigate if this is even possible using the Kerberos API C library.
A more attractive solution to this performance problem is to get a TGT
in the client (qsub or qmon4) which is valid for any host but to prevent
this TGT from being written to the user's credentials cache (Hopefully,
not making this TGT available in the user's credential cache would address
any security concerns of a wildcard TGT). Then the wild-card TGT could
be passed to the qmaster who would store it in the job entry and pass it
to the execution host when the job executes. The cod_execd or cod_shepherd
could use this wildcard TGT to get a specific TGT valid on the execution
host and then destroy the original wild-card TGT.

<h4>
GRD Kerberization Level Two Design</h4>

<h4>
Data Structures</h4>

<h4>
Design Notes</h4>
Q. How do we prevent a job's tickets from expiring while the job is queued?
<p>A. If this is a requirement, then the qmaster (or some other external
process such as the scheduler) will need to occasionally go through all
of the job entries and look for TGTs which are about to expire and contact
the KDC to request a new TGT for that job. Of course, contacting the KDC
will impose some overhead and care should be taken that this does not cause
performance problems. GRD should also continue to keep the TGT in the qmaster
valid for as long as the job is executing, just in case we have to restart
the job at a later time. It might also make sense that when the shepherd
gets a TGT for the job that it gets a TGT which is valid for a reasonably
long period of time.
<p>Q. How can we prevent a job's tickets from expiring while the job is
executing?
<p>A. The cod_shepherd could continually renew the TGT of the client on
a regular basis. The cod_shepherd could do this directly or spawn a separate
process to do it. When the TGT is renewed the new TGT would be placed in
the user's credential cache making it available to processes executing
as part of the user's job. (Thanks to Fritz for this suggestion.)
