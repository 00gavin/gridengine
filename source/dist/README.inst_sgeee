        Installing Grid Engine as Grid Engine Enterprise Edition
        --------------------------------------------------------

If you want to install Grid Engine in the Enterprise Edition mode please
call

    ./inst_sgeee   (with the appropriate command line arguments)

or edit the scripts "install_execd" and "install_qmaster" in this directory
to call "inst_sgeee" instead of "inst_sge".
