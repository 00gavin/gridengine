This package is provided to enhance the suspend and resume methods 
for Sun MPI jobs running under close integration between Sun HPC 
ClusterTools 5 and Sun Grid Engine (SGE) 5.3 software. 

It should be noted that the package is provided on "as is" 
basis and may not work with all of Grid Engine functions. 

The package includes the following files:

README (this file)
suspend_sunmpi_ci.sh
resume_sunmpi_ci.sh
pe_sunmpi_ci.template

The procedure to configure SGE for close integration is explained in detail 
in "Sun HPC ClusterTools 5 Software Administrator's Guide" 
(Part No. 817-0083-10). 

The provided PE template file (pe_sunmpi_ci.template) in this package 
can be used as a reference to configure a PE object.

One additional step is needed to configure all SGE queues listed in 
the SGE PE objects for suspend and resume methods to use the scripts
provided in this package. 

For each queue assigned to the PE objects for close integration, 
the following customization should made for suspend_method and 
resume_method parameters:

qconf -mq <queue_name>
...
suspend_method       /path/to/suspend_sunmpi_ci.sh $job_pid $job_id
resume_method        /path/to/resume_sunmpi_ci.sh $job_pid
...

========================================
Problem Description & Resolution
========================================

When a suspend command (qdel -s) is issued on a Sun MPI job submitted
through SGE close integration, SGE sends a SIGSTOP signal to its master 
process which in turn sends the SIGSTOP signal to the mprun process.
However, the mprun process expects a SIGTSTP signal in order send the 
SIGSTOP signal to all MPI processes which belong to the Sun MPI job.
Thus, although the SGE qstat command shows that all MPI processes are
suspended, the actual MPI processes are still running.

In order to resolve this problem, suspend and resume methods are used,
which is defined for each queue. These enhanced suspend and resume scripts 
use the Sun CRE (Cluster Runtime Environment) mpkill command to send 
SIGSTOP and SIGSTOP signals to all the MPI processes.
