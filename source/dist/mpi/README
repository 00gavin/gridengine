              README         - this file 
   1.         startmpi.sh    - the startup script for MPI
   2.         stopmpi.sh     - the shutdown script for MPI
   3.         mpi.template   - a MPI PE template configuration for Grid Engine
   4.         mpich.template - a MPICH PE template configuration for Grid Engine
                               (tight integration)
   5.         mpi.sh         - a sample MPI job
   6.         mpi_cpi.sh     - another MPI job

Refer to the "Installation and Administration Guide" Chapter "Support
of Parallel Environments" for a general introduction to the Parallel
Environment Interface of Grid Engine

1. The starter script 'startmpi.sh' needs some command line arguments, to 
   be configured by use of either qmon or qconf. The first one is the path
   to the "$pe_hostfile" that gets transformed by startmpi.sh into a
   MPI machine file. On successful completion startmpi.sh creates a
   machine file in $TMPDIR/machines to be passed to "mpirun" at job
   start.

   $TMPDIR is a temporary directory created and removed by the Grid Engine
   execution daemon.

2. The stopper 'stopmpi.sh' just removes $TMPDIR/machines.  

3. Use this template as a starting point when establishing a parallel
   environment for MPI without tight integration. You need to replace
   <a_list_of_parallel_queues>, <the_number_of_slots> and <your_sge_root>
   with the appropriate information.

   Grid Engine offers an additional interface which allows a tighter
   integration with public domain MPI (MPICH). Tighter integration means
   that all tasks of your MPICH application are under full control of
   Grid Engine. This is precondition for some additional benefits:

   - full accounting also for all tasks of MPI jobs
   - resource limits are effective for all tasks
   - all tasks are started with the appropriate nice value which was
     configured as 'priority' in the queues configuration

4. Use this template as a starting point when establishing a parallel
   environment for MPICH with tight integration. You need to replace
   <a_list_of_parallel_queues>, <the_number_of_slots> and <your_sge_root>
   with the appropriate information.

   Here is a list of problems for which tight integration provides solutions
   - resource limits are enforced also for tasks at slave hosts
   - resource consumption at slave hosts can be accounted
   - no need to write a customized terminate method to ensure
     that whole job is finished on qdel
 
   Here is a list of problems which are not solved by the tight integration
   - can't trigger job finish if application finishes partially

   There are two samples included. You should use these samples to verify
   that your integration of Grid Engine with MPI/MPICH works correctly.

5. The first job example 'mpi.sh' starts the 'life' program from the mpich
   distribution using mpirun. Since this program needs the problem dimension
   to be entered interactively, necessary parameters get piped into 'life'.

   Please note that a MPI job that has to start 'mpirun' with the option
   
      -np $NSLOTS

   to start the job with the correct number of slots ($NSLOTS is set by
   Grid Engine). To pass information where to start the MPI tasks one has to
   pass

      -machinefile $TMPDIR/machines

   as the second argument.  
   
6. The second example is a wrapper to start 'cpi' from the mpich
   distribution.
