<H1><FONT SIZE=6 STYLE="font-size: 28pt">DRMAA C binding for Grid Engine</FONT></H1>
<H1>Overview</H1>
<P>The purpose of this library is to provide an implementation for the DRMAA C binding 
standard based on Grid Engine DRM system. The best way to circumscribe DRMAA is to cite 
the DRMAA-WG Charter:</P>
<UL>
<P>"Develop an API specification for the submission and control of jobs to one or more Distributed Resource
Management (DRM) systems. The scope of this specification is all the high level functionality which is
necessary for an application to consign a job to a DRM system including common operations on jobs like
termination or suspension.</P>
<P>The objective is to facilitate the direct interfacing of applications to today's DRM systems by
application's builders, portal builders, and Independent Software Vendors (ISVs)."</P>
</UL>
<P>For more details on the 
<A HREF="http://www.gridforum.org">Global Grid Forum</A>
standards body working group refer to the page of the
<A HREF="http://www.drmaa.org">GGF DRMAA working group</A>
.
</P>
<H1>Documentation</H1>
<P>The following DRMAA related documentation is recommended
<A HREF="http://www.drmaa.org/docs/ggf-rec-drmaa-1_0.pdf">DRMAA 1.0 language independent specification</A>,
<A HREF="https://forge.gridforum.org/tracker/?group_id=90&atid=608&aid=214">DRMAA C language binding specification</A> 
and 
<A HREF="http://gridengine.sunsource.net/unbranded-source/browse/~checkout~/gridengine/doc/htmlman/manuals.html?content-type=text/html">HTML version of Grid Engine DRMAA C binding man pages (only those with drmaa_* prefixes)</A>

.</P>
<H1>Availability</H1>
<P>At this stage DRMAA is only available as a source snapshot from the "maintrunk" of the Grid Engine.
In the 5.3 release source branch DRMAA does not exist.</P> <P>At this point in time the following Grid Engine binary architectures are know to be working:</P>
<UL>
   <LI><P>solaris (Sparc Solaris 2.6, 7, 8, 9  32-bit)</P>
   <LI><P>solaris64 (Sparc Solaris 7, 8, 9  64-bit</P>
   <LI><P>solaris86 (x86 Solaris 8)</P>
   <LI><P>glinux (x86 Linux, kernel 2.4, glibc >= 2.2)</P>
</UL>
<P>There are three build targets that are related to DRMAA:</P>
<UL>
   <LI><P>libdrmaa.a - a DRMAA library for statically linking</P>
   <LI><P>libjapi.a - a JAPI library for statically linking</P>
   <LI><P>test_drmaa - a test DRMAA application used for QA</P>
</UL>

<P>For building 
The steps described in the 
<A HREF="http://gridengine.sunsource.net/unbranded-source/browse/~checkout~/gridengine/source/README.BUILD">Grid Engine build page</A> 
are the same that also must be followed for building the DRMAA build targets. In case of 
Grid Engine binary architectures where the Port is already done the command</P>
<UL>
   aimk 
</UL>
<P>compiles all Grid Engine binaries plus DRMAA build targets. To enforce compliation
of DRMAA build targets for not yet ported binary architectures 
<UL>
   aimk -only-mt 
</UL>
<P>can be used. To compile all Grid Engine binaries except the DRMAA build targets</P>
<UL>
   aimk -no-mt 
</UL>
<P>can be used.</P>
<H1>Example application</H1>
<P>The C test program 
<A HREF="http://gridengine.sunsource.net/source/browse/gridengine/source/libs/japi/example.c">example.c</A>
is a good example of an application that uses the DRMAA C binding interface. 
It illustrates submission of both single and bulk remote jobs. After submission drmaa_synchronize() call 
is used to synchronize the remote jobs execution. The call returns after all the jobs have finished 
executing. Finally, drmaa_wait() call is used to retrieve and print out the remote jobs execution 
information.</P>
<P>A full path for the remote command is passed as the first argument to the test program. 
That value is directly used as &quot;drmaa_remote_command&quot; job template attribute. The C binding example uses 
value  &quot;5&quot; as a first argument to the job template vector attribute &quot;drmaa_v_argv&quot;. Passing &quot;/bin/sleep&quot; as 
a first argument to the test program will for example cause 32 sleep jobs to be run that sleep for &quot;5&quot; 
seconds each before finishing execution.  Note that we expect to find  &quot;/bin/sleep&quot; command on all of the 
remote nodes.</P>
<P>To build this example run
<UL>
   aimk -no-mt example
</UL>
This is necessary because "example" is not part of the standard build procedure.</P>
<H1>Bugs</H1>
You can file bugs to Grid Engine Issuezilla "drmaa" subcomponent. Before doing so please have a 
look at the TODO list below and watch out for already submitted "drmaa" bugs. If you're not sure 
whether you found a bug sending mail to 
<A HREF="http://gridengine.sunsource.net/project/gridengine/maillist.html">dev@gridengine.sunsource.net Mailinglist</A> 
is recommended.
<H1>Notes on implementation</H1>
<P>The Grid Engine implementation of DRMAA bases on Grid Engine 
<A HREF="http://gridengine.sunsource.net/unbranded-source/browse/%7Echeckout%7E/gridengine/source/libs/japi/japi.html?content-type=text/html">Job
API library (JAPI)</A>. Regarding the interfaces operations Grid Engine JAPI library and DRMAA library have lots 
of similarities. The big difference amongst them is that JAPI allows any characteristic of the Grid Engine job 
that is submitted through JAPI be influenced, whereas DRMAA allows only those characteristics be influenced that 
are interfaced by DRMAA. Note that this ostensible drawback of DRMAA library is not as meaningful as it seems: 
Firstly DRMAA job template attributes "drmaa_job_category" and "drmaa_native_specification" will allow nearly all 
of the qsub(1) job characteristics be influenced. And secondly by building an integration upon DRMAA library you 
don't need to change your application code each time when a new Grid Engine version is released. When using JAPI 
library interface you must be prepared to change your application code. This is because JAPI directly exports Grid 
Engine internal data structures and these usually are subject of change with new releases. Note that DRMAA library
inherits MT safety from JAPI library.</P>
<H1>TODO</H1>
This list contains items that are not yet implemented but required for a DRMAA 1.0 compliant 
implementation:
<UL>
   <LI><P>shared drmaa library (currently only static library linking can be used)</P>
   <LI><P>implement DRMAA job template attribute "drmaa_job_category"</P>
   <LI><P>implement DRMAA job template attribute "drmaa_native_specification"</P>
   <LI><P>implement DRMAA job template attribute "drmaa_v_env"</P>
   <LI><P>implement DRMAA job template attribute "drmaa_v_email"</P>
   <LI><P>implement DRMAA job template attribute "drmaa_block_email"</P>
   <LI><P>implement DRMAA job template attribute "drmaa_start_time"</P>
   <LI><P>implement drmaa_wait(3) output parameter rusage</P>
   <LI><P>drmaa_wait(3) does not yet return DRMAA_ERRNO_NO_RUSAGE as foreseen by spec</P>
</UL>
<H1>Grid Engine DRMAA library QA effort</H1>
<P>The DRMAA application "test_drmaa" is used by Grid Engine testsuite QA tool to ensure quality of DRMAA 
library. It covers a growing number of tests. There are so-called standalone tests that can
be accomplished autonomously by the test_drmaa application. To run all these tests standalone "test_drmaa" 
can be started with the "ALL_AUTOMATED" option plus some option arguments. To run all so far implemented tests 
related to DRMAA choose "api/drmaa" in testsuite and have testsuite do the work for you.</P>
