-- SWIG-1.3a5, version of swig used to build the c/perl wrappers
   http://www.swig.org
   http://download.sourceforge.net/swig/swig1.3a5.tar.gz
   
-- Perl 5.6, corresponding PerlTk module v8.0  
   http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Tk 

-- $SGE_ROOT/lib/<arch>/libsge.so
   part of the SGE distribution

To build, install swig, perl, perltk.
Then do:
% make
this generates the perl/c-wrapper code and compiles it.
The generated files are:
   1. SGE_wrap.c
      SGE.pm

   2. SGE.so
      SGE_wrap.o

If you "make realclean", 1. and 2. are deleted,
if you type a simple "make clean" only the
binaries (2.) are deleted.
The wrapper code is believed to be platform-
independend, so that there is no need to
build it everytime, but once.

make gets it's information how to build the
shared library SGE.so from perl itself;
thus if you have a perl-binary that is
in a different binary format (by the meaning of
"compiled") then the shared library of GridEngine,
it won't work ... (e.g. 32bit-perl and 64bit GridEngine).

HOW TO INSTALL:
===============

copy the following files into you favourite place:

SGE.pm
SGE.so
Qmon.pl
Qmon  <the whole directory>

and adjust the path of the perl-binary
in the first line of Qmon.pl

HOW TO RUN:
===========
Set your environment: % setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH .:$SGE_ROOT/lib/$ARCH

Adjust the #!/usr/bin/perl in Qmon.pl to your perl path and simply type

% ./Qmon.pl

or do

% perl Qmon.pl


DOCUMENTATION REMARKS:
======================

There is additional documentation available under doku, although it is in German
it might be helpful nevertheless.
The Diplomathesis of Markus Grabert contains a lot of references to the old
productnames. The following translation rules apply:

cod -> sge
api -> gdi
CODINE/COD -> SGE
API -> GDI

The code has been adapted to run with the new libraries.
