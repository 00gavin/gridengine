<h1>
The shepherd</h1>
The shepherd is the instance in Grid Engine, that starts and controls a
job. It
<ul>
<li>
sets up resources before the job start (prolog, PE start-up).</li>

<li>
sets the jobs environment, limits etc.</li>

<li>
starts the job (as a child process of shepherd).</li>

<li>
controlls the job - sends signals to the job (suspend/unsuspend, terminate),
takes care of checkpointing/migration of a job.</li>

<li>
after job termination cleans up resources (PE shut-down, epilog).</li>
</ul>

<h2>
Process Flow</h2>

<h3>
Initialization</h3>
The following actions are taken to initialize the shepherd (see <tt>source/clients/shepherd.c:&nbsp;
main</tt>):
<ul>
<li>
Setup signal handlers and signal masks<br>
(<tt>source/libs/uti/sge_set_def_sig_mask.c: sge_set_def_sig_mask,&nbsp;
source/clients/shepherd.c: set_sig_handler, source/clients/shepherd.c:
set_shepherd_signal_mask</tt>)</li>

<li>
Read configuration for job<br>
(<tt>source/daemons/common/config_file: read_config</tt>)</li>

<li>
Check the configuration (<tt>source/daemons/shepherd/shepherd.c:&nbsp;verify_method</tt>):</li>

<ul>
<li>
Terminate, suspend, resume methods.</li>

<li>
Access to the jobs spool directory.</li>

<li>
Validity of the checkpointing interface.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h3>
Setting up the job environment</h3>
A job runs in a defined process environment. This process environment comprises
of environment variables, limits, special parallel processing environments,
security settings etc.
<p>In addition to the standard setup procedure, scripts can be defined
to be executed as prolog/epilog for the job and as setup/shutdown procedure
for parallel environments.
<p>Other components of the job environment can be:
<ul>
<li>
If available (depends on system platform) and requested: setup a processor
set for the job.</li>

<li>
If available and requested: setup AFS security mechanism.</li>

<li>
If requested: start a prolog script (see <font color="#FF0000">queue_conf(5)</font>).</li>

<li>
In case of parallel jobs that need special setup: start a pe startup procedure
(see <font color="#FF0000">sge_pe(5)</font>).</li>
</ul>
This process environment is setup in <tt>source/daemons/shepherd/shepherd.c:
main</tt>
<h3>
Running the job</h3>
A job is executed as a child process of the shepherd process. During the
runtime of the job, the shepherd parent process controls its child and
may send signals to the child process.
<p>The job's startup contains the following steps (see <tt>source/daemons/shepherd/shepherd.c:&nbsp;start_child</tt>):
<blockquote>
<li>
If the job has been checkpointed previously and shall now be rerun, a checkpoint
restart method is setup.</li>

<li>
Fork a child process that will execute the job.</li>

<li>
The parent waits for the child to exit, if any signals have to be delivered
to the job, the parent process sends these signals to the process group
of its child process.</li>

<li>
The child process starts up the job (see <tt>source/daemons/shepherd/builtin_starter.c:&nbsp;son
</tt>and <tt>source/daemons/shepherd/builtin_starter.c:&nbsp;start_command</tt>):</li>

<ul>
<li>
Setup an own process group.</li>

<li>
Set limits according to queue/job configuration.</li>

<li>
Setup the environment variables.</li>

<li>
If requested, set a special group id different from the users primary group
id (see execd_param <tt>USE_QSUB_GID</tt> in the cluster configuration
- <font color="#FF0000">sge_conf(5)</font>).</li>

<li>
Set an operating system job id, if the operating system provides this feature,
otherwise set an additional user group id to controll/monitor all child
processes of the job, see <font color="#FF0000">documentation of the execd</font></li>

<li>
Setup the redirection of stdin (from /dev/null) and stdout/stderr (to files)</li>

<li>
Setup the commandline depending on the type of job (jobscript, qsh, qlogin/qrsh):</li>

<ul>
<li>
If it is a batch job, execute the jobscript with commandline parameters.</li>

<li>
If it is a qsh job, start an xterm process as defined in the cluster configuration,
parameter xterm, see <font color="#FF0000">sge_conf(5)</font>.</li>

<li>
If it is a qrsh or qlogin job, call the qlogin_starter that starts a telnetd,
rshd or rlogind as defined in the cluster configuration, parameters qlogin_daemon,
rsh_daemon and rlogin_daemon, see <font color="#FF0000">sge_conf(5)</font>.</li>
</ul>

<li>
Execute the commandline built in the previous step.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
After a job exits, job information is spooled in the job's spool directory
for further use by the execution daemon containing:
<ul>
<li>
exit code</li>

<li>
usage / accounting information</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Cleaning up the job environment</h3>
After a job has terminated, the job is cleaned up:
<ul>
<li>
If it is a parallel job and a pe stop procedure has been defined: Execute
the pe stop procedure (see <font color="#FF0000">sge_pe(5)</font>).</li>

<li>
Execute an epilog script if defined (see <font color="#FF0000">queue_conf(5)</font>).</li>

<li>
Free a previously defined processor set.</li>

<li>
Shutdown security mechanisms setup during job setup.</li>

<li>
Write the job's exit code to file and eventually to a qrsh process (see
also "<a href="#Communication with qlogin/qrsh">Communication with qrsh</a>").</li>
</ul>
The process environment is cleaned up in <tt>source/daemons/shepherd/shepherd.c:
main</tt>
<h2>
Communication with the execd - spooled files</h2>
The Shepherd and the execution daemon share some information by writing
spool files .
<p>The execution daemon passes information like the jobs configuration
and the environment to shepherd (see for example <tt>source/daemons/execd/exec_job.c:&nbsp;sge_exec_job</tt>),
<br>the shepherd reports information like the jobs exit code and usage
information back to the execution daemon (see for example <tt>source/daemons/shepherd/shepherd.c:
wait_my_child</tt>).
<p>The spool files are located in a host specific spool directory (usually
<tt>$SGE_ROOT/default/spool/&lt;hostname></tt>). The spool directory can
be defined in the cluster configuration (see parameter <tt>execd_spool_dir</tt>
in the cluster configuration, <font color="#FF0000">sge_conf(5)</font>).
<p>Under the host specific spool directory, a subdirectory active_jobs
is created by the execd, for each job, the execd creates a subdirectory
<tt>&lt;jobid>.&lt;taskid></tt> that holds the job specific spool files.
<br>If the job is a parallel job with a tight integration, this job specific
spool directory is created on each execution host involved in the execution
of the job, for each task a subdirectory <tt>&lt;petaskid></tt> is created
that holds the task specific spool files.
<p>The following spool files exist in Grid Engine:
<ul>
<li>
<b><i><tt>addgrpid<br>
</tt></i></b>Contains one line with the additional group id used to control
and monitor the job, if the operating system does not provide the feature
of a jobid (see <a href="#osjobid">file osjobid</a>)</li>

<li>
<b><tt>checkpointed<br>
</tt></b>If a checkpointed job is restarted, shepherd writes a "1" into
this file. If a new checkpointing is requested during startup of the job,
no new checkpoint will be written.</li>

<li>
<b><tt>config<br>
</tt></b>The job's configuration - contains one line per configuration
parameter</li>

<li>
<b><tt>environment<br>
</tt></b>All environment variables to be setup for the job in the form
<tt>&lt;variable>=&lt;value></tt>. This file is written by the execd and
used by shepherd to setup the job's environment</li>

<li>
<b><tt>error<br>
</tt></b>Contains an error message in case of severe errors during the
startup of a job (e.g. Execd cannot start shepherd)</li>

<li>
<b><tt>exit_status<br>
</tt></b>The numeric exit code of the job in one single line</li>

<li>
<b><tt>job_pid<br>
</tt></b>The process id of the job (the shepherd's child process)</li>

<li>
<a NAME="osjobid"></a><b><tt>osjobid<br>
</tt></b>Contains one line with the operating system jobid used to control
and monitor the job (if the operating system provides this feature)</li>

<li>
<b><tt>pid<br>
</tt></b>The process id of the shepherd</li>

<li>
<b><tt>processor_set_number<br>
</tt></b>If a processor set is created for the execution of a job, the
shepherd writes the processor set number to this file. It is used after
job exit to free the processor set.</li>

<li>
<b><tt>shepherd_about_to_exit<br>
</tt></b>In parallel jobs, multiple instances of a task may be executed
in sequence. For example a qmake job will be assigned a fixed number of
slots in a Grid Engine cluster and will execute multiple tasks (e.g. Compile
tasks) in each slot.<br>
If this happens in fast sequence, the execd may not yet have seen the termination
of a previously exited task when it receives the order to start the next
task. If in this case all slots are in use, and the execd would therefore
have to reject the execution of an additional task, it checks the existence
of the spool file "<tt>shepherd_about_to_exit</tt>" for all running tasks
of the job that requests execution of the next task; if it finds a task
that has already exited but is not yet cleaned up, it can allow the execution
of the next task.</li>

<li>
<b><tt>signal<br>
</tt></b>Usually, if shepherd has to deliver a signal to a job, the execd
will notify the shepherd with (potentially another) signal, which the shepherd
then maps to the signal to deliver and sends it to the job's process group.<br>
If shepherd receives a <tt>SIGTTIN</tt>, it reads the signal to deliver
from the spoolfile "<tt>signal</tt>" and sends this signal to the job's
process group.</li>

<li>
<b><tt>trace<br>
</tt></b>A file containing debug information about the job's execution</li>
</ul>
If the job is a parallel job, the following additional files are created
<ul>
<li>
if it is a parallel job with tight integration, a subdirectory for each
task containing the files described above for each task</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b><tt>pe_hostfile<br>
</tt></b>A file describing the host setup of a parallel job, containing
each involved host, the queues the job was spooled into and the number
of reserved slots (tasks) per host</li>
</ul>

<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="Communication with qlogin/qrsh"></a>Communication with qlogin/qrsh</h2>
Interactive jobs submitted using qlogin or qrsh require additional communication
between shepherd and the qlogin/qrsh client command (see also <font color="#FF0000">documentation
of qrsh</font>).
<p>Qlogin/qrsh sets up a socket and writes the port address to an environment
variable "QRSH_PORT" in the format "&lt;host>:&lt;port>" (see <tt>source/clients/qsh/qsh.c:
main</tt>).
<p>The shepherd connects to this port and sends the following information
to the qlogin/qrsh client:
<ul>
<li>
If an error occurs during job setup or the further job monitoring, an error
message will be sent to qlogin/qrsh in the format:<br>
"<tt>1:&lt;error message></tt>"<br>
(see <tt>source/daemons/common/err_trace.c:&nbsp;shepherd_error_impl</tt>)</li>

<li>
To initialize a telnet/rsh/rlogin connection, the shepherd creates a socket
port to which the client command telnet/rsh/rlogin shall connect.<br>
The address of this port is communicated to the qlogin/qrsh client in the
format:<br>
"<tt>0:&lt;port>:&lt;rootdir>:&lt;arch>:&lt;spool dir>:&lt;hostname></tt>",
where</li>

<ul>
<li>
port is the socket port number</li>

<li>
rootdir is the path to the SGE root directory (<tt>$SGE_ROOT</tt>)</li>

<li>
arch is the architecture of the execution host (<tt>$SGE_ROOT/util/arch</tt>)</li>

<li>
spool_dir is the job's spool directory (usually <tt>$SGE_ROOT/default/spool/&lt;hostname>/active_jobs/&lt;job_id>.&lt;taskid></tt>)</li>

<li>
hostname is the name of the execution host</li>
</ul>
(see <tt>daemons/common/qlogin_starter.c: qlogin_starter</tt>)
<br>If the interactive job has exited, the exit code is written to the
qlogin/qrsh client as number in ASCII format.<br>
(see <tt>source/daemons/common/qlogin_starter.c:&nbsp;write_exit_code_to_qrsh</tt>)</ul>
